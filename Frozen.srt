1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 

4
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:01,120
Born of cold and winter air and mountain rain combining

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,500
This icy force both foul and fair

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,010
Has a frozen heart worth mining

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,010
So cut through the heart, cold and clear

8
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,300
Strike for love and strike for fear

9
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,180
See the beauty sharp and sheer

10
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,100
Split the ice apart

11
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,480
And break the frozen heart

12
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,810
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go

13
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go

14
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,320
Beautiful! Powerful

15
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,530
Dangerous! Cold

16
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,900
Ice has a magic can't be controlled

17
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,160
Stronger than one, stronger than ten

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,410
Stronger than a hundred men

19
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,790
Born of cold and winter air and mountain rain combining

20
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,960
This icy force both foul and fair

21
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,130
Has a frozen heart worth mining

22
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,050
Cut through the heart, cold and clear

23
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,590
Strike for love and strike for fear

24
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,920
There's beauty and there's danger here

25
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,260
Split the ice apart

26
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,680
Beware the frozen heart

27
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,850
Come on, Sven!

28
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,330
Elsa. Psst!

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,460
Elsa!

30
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,920
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

31
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,960
Anna, go back to sleep.

32
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,380
I just can't. The sky's awake, so I'm awake

33
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,890
so we have to play.

34
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:03,390
Go play by yourself.

35
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,770
Do you want to build a snowman?

36
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,270
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

37
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,070
Do the magic! Do the magic!

38
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,070
Ready?

39
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,790
This is amazing!

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,870
Watch this!

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,880
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

42
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,220
I love you, Olaf.

43
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,480
--- - Hang on. - Catch me! - Gotcha!

44
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,070
-- - Again! - Wait!

45
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,150
Slow down!

46
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,280
Anna!

47
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,240
Anna?

48
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,620
Mama! Papa!

49
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,460
You're okay, Anna. I got you.

50
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,300
Elsa, what have you done? This is getting out of hand!

51
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,680
It was an accident. I'm sorry, Anna.

52
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,810
-- - She's ice cold. - I know where we have to go.

53
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,110
Ice?

54
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,160
Faster, Sven!

55
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,740
Sven!

56
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,750
Please... Help!

57
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,040
My daughter!

58
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,680
He is the King!

59
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,510
Trolls...?

60
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,970
Shush. I'm trying to listen.

61
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,640
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

62
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,850
Your Majesty!

63
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,310
Born with the powers or cursed?

64
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,770
Born. And they're getting stronger.

65
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,530
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

66
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,320
The heart is not so easily changed

67
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,990
but the head can be persuaded.

68
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,780
Do what you must.

69
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,620
I recommend we remove all magic

70
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,250
even memories of magic to be safe...

71
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,290
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.

72
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,960
She will be okay.

73
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,920
But she won't remember I have powers?

74
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,840
-- - It's for the best. - Listen to me, Elsa

75
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,100
your power will only grow.

76
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,430
There is beauty in it...

77
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,220
but also great danger.

78
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,020
You must learn to control it.

79
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,270
Fear will be your enemy.

80
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,400
No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

81
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,400
Until then

82
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,740
we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff.

83
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,120
We will limit her contact with people

84
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,160
and keep her powers hidden from everyone...

85
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,170
including Anna.

86
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,130
Elsa?

87
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,350
Do you want to build a snowman

88
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,510
Come on let's go and play

89
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,310
I never see you anymore. Come out the door

90
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,350
It's like you've gone away

91
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,650
We used to be best buddies

92
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,940
And now we're not. I wish you would tell me why

93
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,530
Do you want to build a snowman

94
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,530
It doesn't have to be a snowman

95
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,570
Go away, Anna.

96
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,620
Okay bye

97
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,580
The gloves will help. See...

98
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,330
-- - Conceal it. - Don't feel it.

99
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,380
Don't let it show.

100
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,840
Do you want to build a snowman

101
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Or ride our bike around the hall

102
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
I think some company is overdue

103
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,390
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls

104
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,510
Hang in there, Joan.

105
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,140
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms

106
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,810
Just watching the hours tick by

107
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

108
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,370
Getting upset only makes it worse.

109
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,280
Calm down.

110
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,450
No. Don't touch me. Please. I don't want to hurt you.

111
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,040
See you in two weeks.

112
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,710
-- - Do you have to go? - You'll be fine, Elsa.

113
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,490
Elsa?

114
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,700
Please, I know you're in there

115
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,120
People are asking where you've been

116
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,710
They say have courage and I'm trying to

117
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,260
I'm right out here for you. Just let me in

118
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,340
We only have each other

119
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,550
It's just you and me

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,010
What are we gonna do

121
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,600
Do you want to build a snowman

122
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,300
-- - Welcome to Arendelle! - Merci, monsieur!

123
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,050
Watch your Steps please. The gates will opening Soon.

124
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,010
Why do I have to wear this?

125
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,010
Because the Queen has come of age.

126
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,010
It's Coronation Day!

127
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,310
That's not my fault.

128
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,980
-- - What do you want, Sven? - Give me a snack!

129
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,110
-- - What's the magic word? - Please!

130
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,280
A..A... a... a! Share!

131
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,700
I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!

132
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,860
And for a whole day!

133
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,660
Faster, Persi!

134
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner.

135
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,620
Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets

136
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,540
and exploit your riches.

137
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,330
Did I just say that out loud?

138
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,960
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to

139
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,630
see the Queen and the Princess.

140
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,840
I bet they're absolutely lovely.

141
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,510
I bet they are beautiful.

142
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,220
Princess Anna...?

143
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,970
Huh? Yeah?

144
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,020
-- - Sorry to wake you, ma'am but... - No, no, no. You didn't.

145
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,600
I've been up for hours.

146
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,270
Who is it?

147
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,480
It's still me, ma'am. The gates will open soon.

148
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,150
-- - Time to get ready. - Of course!

149
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,360
Ready for what?

150
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,780
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

151
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,780
My sister's cor-neration...

152
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,580
It's coronation day!

153
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,170
It's coronation day!

154
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,790
The window is open! So's that door

155
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,380
I didn't know they did that anymore

156
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,420
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates

157
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,420
For years I have roamed these empty halls

158
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,640
Why have a ballroom with no balls

159
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,810
Finally, they're opening up the gates

160
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,930
There'll be actual, real-life people

161
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,230
It'll be totally strange

162
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,230
But wow am I so ready for this change

163
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,940
'Cause for the first time in forever

164
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,360
There'll be music, there'll be light

165
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,030
For the first time in forever

166
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,830
I'll be dancing through the night

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

168
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,210
But I'm somewhere in that zone

169
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,590
'Cause for the first time in forever

170
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,340
I won't be alone. I can't wait to meet everyone...

171
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,090
What if I meet "The one"?

172
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,430
Tonight, imagine me gown and all

173
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,720
Fetchingly draped against the wall

174
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,970
The picture of sophisticated Grace

175
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,770
I suddenly see him standing there

176
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,310
a beautiful stranger tall and fair

177
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,610
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

178
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,280
But then we laugh and talk all evening

179
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,860
Which is totally bizarre

180
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,740
Nothing like the life I've led so far

181
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,030
For the first time in forever

182
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,950
There'll be magic, there'll be fun

183
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,290
For the first time in forever

184
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,250
I could be noticed by someone

185
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,920
And I know it is totally crazy

186
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,010
To dream I'd find romance

187
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,180
But for the first time in forever

188
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,010
At least I've got a chance

189
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,230
Don't let them in. Don't let them see

190
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,440
Be the good girl You always have to be

191
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,320
Conceal. Don't feel.

192
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,950
Put on a show.

193
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,990
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

194
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,790
But it's only for today

195
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,640
It's only for today

196
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,210
It's agony to wait

197
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,000
It's agony to wait

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,380
Tell the guards to open up the gate

199
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,090
The gate

200
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,960
For the first time in forever

201
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.

202
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
Be the good girl you always have to be.

203
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,350
A chance to change my only world.

204
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,190
Conceal.

205
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,060
A chance to find true love

206
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,980
Conceal. Don't feel, Don't let them know

207
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,150
I know it all ends tomorrow

208
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,070
So it has to be today

209
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,320
'Cause for the first time in forever

210
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,040
For the first time in forever

211
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,200
Nothing's in my way

212
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,840
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

213
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,210
Hey!

214
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,260
-- - I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. - Are you sure?

215
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,140
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.

216
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,390
-- - But I'm great, actually. - Oh, thank goodness.

217
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,730
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

218
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,900
-- - Princess Anna of Arendelle. - Princess...?

219
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,690
My Lady.

220
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,900
Hi... again.

221
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,900
Oh boy.

222
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,910
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward

223
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,990
but just because we're...I'm awkward.

224
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,450
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

225
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,740
I'd like to formally apologize for

226
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,330
hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...

227
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,540
and for every moment after.

228
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,410
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess.

229
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,250
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be...

230
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,750
'cuz, you know...

231
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,790
Hello.

232
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,510
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

233
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,630
Just you?

234
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,470
The bells. The coronation.

235
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,770
I... I...

236
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,270
I better go. I have to...I better go.

237
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,190
Bye!

238
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,560
Your Majesty, The gloves.

239
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,080
Sem hon heldr inum helgum eignum ok

240
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:42,540
krýnd í þessum helga stað ek té fram fyrir yðr

241
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,920
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

242
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,130
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

243
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,770
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

244
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,020
Princess Anna of Arendelle!

245
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,320
Here? Are you sure? I do not think I suppose to...Okay.

246
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,750
Hi.

247
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,120
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

248
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,590
-- - You look beautiful... -Thank you.

249
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,800
You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller.

250
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
You don't look fuller, but more beautiful.

251
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,800
Thank you.

252
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,590
So, this is what a party looks like?

253
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,140
It's warmer than I thought.

254
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,850
And what is that amazing smell?

255
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,600
Chocolate.

256
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,110
Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.

257
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,730
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton..

258
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,360
Your Majesty

259
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,030
as your closest partner in trade

260
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,280
it seems only fitting that I offer you

261
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,740
your first dance as Queen.

262
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,460
Thank you. Only I don't dance.

263
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,790
But my sister does.

264
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,830
-- - Lucky you...- Oh, I don't think...

265
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,590
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.

266
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,090
Sorry.

267
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,760
Like an agile peacock...

268
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,670
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.

269
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,220
Why did they shut them in the first place?

270
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,180
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

271
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
No. No...

272
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,270
Oh, all right. Hang on.

273
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,730
"" They don't call me "The little dipper" for nothing.

274
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,110
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey... I fly.

275
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,860
Let me know when you're ready for another round, My Lady.

276
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Well, he was sprightly.

277
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,450
Especially for a man in heels.

278
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,700
-- - Are you okay? - I've never been better.

279
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,870
This is so nice.

280
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,450
I wish it could be like this all the time.

281
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,460
Me too...

282
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,790
But it can't.

283
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,710
-- - Why not? If... - It just can't.

284
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,760
Excuse me for a minute.

285
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,020
-- - Glad I caught you. - Hans!

286
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,860
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

287
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,490
Your physique helps, I'm sure too.

288
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,120
-- - What's this? - I was born with it

289
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,540
Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

290
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,000
I like it.

291
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,620
Yeah, The whole thing! You got it.

292
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,000
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,170
Twelve older brothers.

294
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,670
Three of them pretended I was invisible...

295
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,010
literally... for two years.

296
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,800
-- - That's horrible. - It's what brothers do.

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,510
And sisters.

298
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,470
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.

299
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,060
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...

300
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,060
And I never knew why.

301
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,560
I would never shut you out.

302
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,690
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

303
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,190
I love crazy.

304
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,650
All my life has been a series of doors in my face

305
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,990
And then suddenly I bump into you

306
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,160
I was thinking the same thing, because like

307
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,290
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place

308
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,750
And maybe it's the party talking

309
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,910
Or the chocolate fondue

310
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,040
But with you

311
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,670
I found my place

312
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,000
I see your face

313
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,090
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

314
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,130
Love is an open... door

315
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,510
Love is an open... door...door

316
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,600
Love is an open... door

317
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,560
With you! With you

318
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,310
Love is an open door

319
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,570
-- - I mean it's crazy. - What?

320
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,690
-- - We finish each other's... - Sandwiches!

321
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,070
That's what I was gonna say

322
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,110
I've never met someone who thinks so much like me

323
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,740
Jinx... jinx again.

324
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,580
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation

325
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,710
You and I were just meant to be

326
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,330
Say goodbye

327
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,340
To the pain of the past

328
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,960
We don't have to feel it anymore

329
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,010
Love is an open... door

330
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,260
Love is an open door

331
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,470
Life can be so much more...with you... with you

332
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,270
Love is an open... door

333
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,690
Can I say something crazy...?

334
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,020
Will you marry me?

335
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,190
Can I just say something even crazier?

336
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,690
Yes.

337
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,490
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there?

338
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,790
Thank you. Oh, there she is.

339
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,410
Elsa! I mean... Queen...

340
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,210
Me again. May I present

341
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,710
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

342
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,540
Your Majesty.

343
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,170
We would like...your blessing...

344
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,130
of... our marriage!

345
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
-- - Marriage...? - Yes!

346
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,220
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

347
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,390
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.

348
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,220
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.

349
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,300
Of course we'll have soup

350
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,390
... roast, and ice cream and then...

351
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,100
Wait. Would we live here?

352
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,810
-- - Here? - Absolutely!

353
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,480
Anna...

354
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,770
12 Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...

355
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,100
What? No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,350
... Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must...

357
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,610
Wait. Slow down.

358
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,400
No one's brothers are staying here.

359
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,070
No one is getting married.

360
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,690
Wait, what?

361
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,780
May I talk to you, please. Alone.

362
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,030
No. Whatever you have to say, you...

363
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,820
you can say to both of us.

364
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,580
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.

365
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,490
You Can if it's true love.

366
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,410
Anna, what do you know about true love?

367
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,000
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.

368
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,290
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.

369
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,840
Now, excuse me.

370
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,590
... Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

371
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,930
No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.

372
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,180
The party is over. Close the gates.

373
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,760
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

375
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,180
Give me my glove!

376
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,810
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.

377
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,930
Then leave.

378
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,810
What did I ever do to you?!

379
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,570
Enough, Anna.

380
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,320
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

381
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,150
Why do you shut the world out?!

382
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,990
What are you so afraid of?!

383
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,240
I said, enough!

384
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,120
Sorcery. I knew there was

385
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,410
something dubious going on here.

386
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,080
Elsa...?

387
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,170
There she is.

388
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,390
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa...

389
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,350
Come drink with us.

390
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,350
Queen Elsa.

391
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,730
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

392
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,360
There she is! Stop her!

393
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,860
Please, just stay away from me.

394
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,360
Stay away!

395
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,410
Monster... Monster!

396
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,920
Elsa!

397
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,840
Elsa...

398
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
Wait, Please!

399
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,060
Elsa, Stop!

400
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,900
-- - Anna! - No.

401
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,150
The Fjord.

402
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,170
Snow?

403
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Yes, snow!

404
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
-- - Are you all right? - No.

405
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,550
-- - Did you know? - No.

406
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,850
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

407
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,550
The Queen has cursed this land!

408
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,260
She must be stopped!

409
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,220
-- - You have to go after her...- Wait, no!

410
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,480
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

411
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,520
Are you a monster, too?

412
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,560
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

413
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
That's right she is.

414
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,570
In the best way.

415
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,320
And my sister's not a monster.

416
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,990
She nearly killed me.

417
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,530
-- - You slipped on ice... - Her ice!

418
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,200
It was an accident. She was scared.

419
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,280
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this...

420
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,530
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

421
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,530
-- - So I'm the one that needs to go after her. - What?

422
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,160
-- - Yeah. - Bring me my horse, please.

423
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,370
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

424
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,370
Elsa's not dangerous.

425
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,460
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.

426
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,210
-- - I'm coming with you...- No.

427
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,000
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.

428
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,010
On my honor.

429
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,590
I leave Prince Hans in charge!

430
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,470
Are you sure you can trust her?

431
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,510
I don't want you getting hurt.

432
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,350
She's my sister

433
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,350
She would never hurt me.

434
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,930
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

435
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,510
Not a footprint to be seen

436
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,850
A kingdom of isolation

437
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,310
And it looks like I'm the Queen

438
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:44,400
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

439
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,400
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

440
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,870
Don't let them in, Don't let them see

441
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,370
Be the good girl you always have to be

442
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,040
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know

443
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,580
Well, Now they know

444
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,550
Let it go. Let it go

445
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,050
Can't hold it back anymore

446
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,420
Let it go. Let it go

447
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,140
Turn away and slam the door

448
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,180
I don't care what they're going to say

449
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,770
Let the storm rage on

450
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,560
The cold never bothered me anyway

451
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,160
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small

452
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,160
And the fears that once controlled me

453
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,540
Can't get to me at all

454
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,080
It's time to see what I can do

455
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,630
To test the limits and break through

456
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,840
No right, No wrong, No rules for me

457
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,210
I'm free!

458
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,840
Let it go! Let it go!

459
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,390
I am one with the wind and sky

460
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,970
Let it go! Let it go!

461
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,480
You'll never see me cry

462
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,350
Here I stand and

463
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,650
Here I'll stay

464
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,400
Let the storm rage on

465
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,250
My power flurries through the air into the ground

466
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:56,330
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

467
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:03,260
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

468
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm never going back

469
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,510
The past is in the past

470
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,180
Let it go! Let it go!

471
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,770
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

472
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,270
Let it go! Let it go!

473
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,070
That perfect girl is gone

474
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,150
Here I stand in the light of day

475
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Let the storm rage on!

476
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,870
The cold never bothered me anyway

477
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,170
Elsa! Elsa!

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Elsa, It's me, Anna...

479
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,840
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.

480
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-fault.

481
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Of course, none of this would have happened

482
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,520
if she'd just told me her secret... ha...

483
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,060
She's a stinker.

484
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,320
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

485
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,690
Oooo-Kay.

486
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,780
Snow, it had to be snow

487
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,790
She couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic

488
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,660
... that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm...

489
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,330
Fire!

490
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,770
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

491
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,770
And Sauna...

492
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,450
Big summer blow out.

493
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,740
Half off swimming suits, clogs

494
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,580
And a sun balm of my own invention, yah?

495
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, great.

496
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,450
For now, how about boots

497
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,870
Winter boots... and dresses?

498
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,330
That would be in our winter department.

499
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,840
Oh. Um, I was just wondering, has another young woman

500
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,180
The Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?

501
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,430
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.

502
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,940
You and this fellow... Hoo hoo.

503
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,690
Big summer blow out.

504
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,400
-- - Carrots. - Hah?

505
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,690
Behind you.

506
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,320
Oh, right. Excuse me.

507
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,530
A real howler in July, yes?

508
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,370
Where ever could it be coming from?

509
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,910
The North Mountain.

510
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,540
North Mountain.

511
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,460
40 That'll be forty.

512
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,000
4010 Forty? No, ten.

513
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,630
Oh dear, that's no good. See.

514
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,290
These are from our winter stock

515
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,290
where supply and demand have a big problem.

516
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,590
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?

517
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,260
I sell ice for a living.

518
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,220
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now.

519
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,180
... I mean, that is really...

520
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,840
Ahem. That's unfortunate.

521
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
40 Still forty. But I will throw in a

522
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,560
visit to Oaken's sauna.

523
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,850
Hi, family.

524
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,230
10 Ten's all I got. Help me out.

525
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,850
Ten will get you this and no more.

526
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,080
Okay, just tell me one thing...

527
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,150
What was happening on the North Mountain?

528
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,150
Did it seem magical?

529
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,490
Yes! Now, back up

530
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,400
while I deal with this crook here.

531
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,490
What did you call me?

532
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,120
Okay. Okay, I'm-Ow! Whoa!

533
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,660
Bye bye.

534
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,790
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

535
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,840
But I did find us a place to sleep.

536
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,840
And it's free.

537
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,760
I'm sorry about this violence.

538
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,510
I will add a quart of lutefisk

539
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,300
so we'll have good feelings.

540
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,470
Just the outfit and boots, yah?

541
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,520
Reindeers are better than people

542
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,110
Sven, don't you think that's true

543
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you

544
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Every one of em's bad, except you

545
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Oh, Thanks, buddy.

546
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,530
But people smell better than reindeers

547
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,540
Sven, don't you think I'm right

548
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,500
That's once again true, for all Except you

549
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,580
You got me, let's call it a night

550
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,050
Good night

551
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:25,170
Don't let the frostbite bite

552
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,180
Nice duet.

553
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,550
Oh, it's just you.

554
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,470
What do you want?

555
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,930
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.

556
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,190
I don't take people places.

557
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,810
Let me rephrase that...

558
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,610
Take me up the North Mountain...

559
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,110
Please.

560
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,320
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

561
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,370
We leave at dawn...

562
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,080
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

563
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,700
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

564
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,790
We leave now. Right now.

565
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,510
Hang on! We like to go fast!

566
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,550
I like fast!

567
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,810
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.

568
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,560
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

569
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,680
Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

570
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,810
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?

571
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,980
Oh well, it was all my fault.

572
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,440
I got engaged but then she freaked out because...

573
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,780
I'd only just met him, you know, that day.

574
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage...

575
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,620
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?

576
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,240
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad.

577
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,500
And then she tried to walk away

578
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,790
and I grabbed her glove...

579
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,540
Hang on. You mean to tell me.

580
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,920
You got engaged to someone you just met?!

581
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,130
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is...

582
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,340
she wore the gloves all the time

583
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,460
So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.

584
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,090
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

585
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,510
Yes, they did...

586
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,100
But Hans is not a stranger.

587
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,470
Oh yeah? What's his last name?

588
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,640
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

589
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,100
-- - What's his favorite food? - Sandwiches.

590
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,560
-- - Best friend's name? - Probably John.

591
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,770
-- - Eye color... - Dreamy.

592
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,400
-- - Foot size? - Foot size doesn't matter.

593
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,730
Have you had a meal with him yet?

594
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,110
What if you hate the way he eats?

595
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,820
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

596
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,020
Picks his nose?

597
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,110
And eats it.

598
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,780
Excuse me, sir. He's a Prince.

599
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,780
All men do it.

600
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,700
Ew. Look it doesn't matter, it's true love.

601
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,790
Doesn't sound like true love.

602
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,830
Are you some sort of love expert?

603
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,000
No. But I have friends who are.

604
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,330
You have friends who are love experts?

605
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,460
-- - I'm not buying it... - Stop talking.

606
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,960
... No, no, no. I'd like to meet these...

607
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,460
No, I mean it.

608
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,340
Shhh.

609
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,850
Sven, go. Go!

610
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,440
-- - What are they? - Wolves.

611
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,350
Wolves?

612
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,730
-- - What do we do? - I've got this.

613
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,980
You just... don't fall off and don't get eaten.

614
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,480
-- - But I wanna help... - No.

615
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,040
Why not?

616
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,230
Because I don't trust your judgment.

617
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,690
Excuse me?!

618
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,360
Who marries a man she just met?

619
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,110
It's true love!

620
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,160
Christopher!

621
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,830
It's Kristoff!

622
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,580
Duck!

623
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,880
-- - You almost set me on fire! - But I didn't.

624
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,920
Get ready to jump, Sven!

625
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,300
You don't tell him what to do!

626
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,760
I do! Jump, Sven!

627
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,780
But I just paid it off.

628
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,400
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

629
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,240
Grab on!

630
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
Pull, Sven! Pull!

631
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,830
I'll replace your sled and everything in it.

632
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,460
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.

633
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,970
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.

634
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,310
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me

635
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,640
for helping anyone ever again.

636
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,730
-- - But she'll die on her own. - I can live with that.

637
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,520
But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.

638
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,860
You know sometimes I really don't like you.

639
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,240
Hold up. We're coming.

640
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,490
You are?!

641
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,570
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

642
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,630
-- - Arendelle... - It's completely frozen.

643
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,420
But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

644
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,460
-- - Will she? - Yeah.

645
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,840
Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?

646
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,090
More like this way.

647
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,450
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.

648
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,710
Yeah... It really is beautiful, isn't it?

649
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,920
But it's so white.

650
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,630
You know, how about a little color?

651
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,170
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...

652
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,970
How 'bout yellow...no, not yellow.

653
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,680
Yellow and snow? Brrrr... no go.

654
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,180
Am I right?

655
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,560
-- - Hi! - You're creepy.

656
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,560
-- - I don't want it! - Backatchya!

657
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,230
Please don't drop me. Come on, it's just a head.

658
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,870
No!

659
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,230
All right, we got off to a bad start.

660
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,190
Ew, ew, the body!

661
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,780
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

662
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,650
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

663
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,740
...Al'right. Wait one second.

664
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,620
-- - Oooh! Thank you! - You're welcome.

665
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,950
Now I'm perfect.

666
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,370
Well, almost.

667
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,370
It was like my whole life got upside down.

668
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,000
... Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I was just...

669
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,540
-- - Woo! Head Rush! - Are you okay?

670
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,000
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

671
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,750
I've always wanted a nose.

672
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,000
So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.

673
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,130
What? Hey! Whoa.

674
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,300
Oh, I love it even more! Hah...

675
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,340
All right, let's start this thing over.

676
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,930
Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.

677
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,560
Olaf?

678
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,770
That's right, Olaf.

679
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,520
And you are?

680
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,440
Oh, um... I'm Anna.

681
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,780
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

682
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,440
That's Sven.

683
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,110
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

684
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,570
Sven.

685
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,240
They're...oh, okay...Makes things easier for me.

686
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,990
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.

687
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,490
I like you, too!

688
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,740
Olaf, did Elsa build you?

689
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,950
Yeah. Why?

690
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,950
-- - You know where she is? - Yeah. Why?

691
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,580
Do you think you could show us the way?

692
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,750
-- - Yeah. Why? - How does this work?

693
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,420
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.

694
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,000
-- - Yeah, Why? - I'll tell you Why.

695
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,010
We need Elsa to bring back Summer.

696
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,630
Summer?

697
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,470
Oh, I don't know why but.

698
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,590
I've always loved the idea of summer

699
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,350
and sun, and all things hot.

700
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,520
Really?

701
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,640
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

702
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,390
Nope!

703
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,270
But sometimes I like to close my eyes

704
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,770
and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.

705
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,160
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz

706
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,990
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

707
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,330
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand

708
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,460
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer

709
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,880
I'll finally see a summer breeze

710
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,790
Blow away a winter storm

711
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,840
And find out what happens to

712
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,300
Solid water, when it gets warm

713
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:21,140
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me

714
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,100
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer

715
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,940
The hot and the cold are both so intense

716
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,520
Put 'em together, it just makes sense

717
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,690
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

718
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,700
But put me in summer and I'll be a

719
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,780
Happy snowman

720
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,410
When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream

721
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,460
Of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam

722
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,790
Oh the sky will be blue

723
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,420
And you guys'll be there too

724
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,840
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer

725
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,180
-- - I'm gonna tell him. - Don't you dare.

726
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,850
In summer

727
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,190
So, Come on! Elsa's this way.

728
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,940
Let's go bring back summer!

729
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,520
I'm coming!

730
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,570
Somebody's got to tell him.

731
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,160
No. No. You've got the bark facing down.

732
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,950
The bark needs to be face-up.

733
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,830
Bark down is drier.

734
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,280
-- - Bark up... - Bark down.

735
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,330
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

736
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,410
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

737
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,710
The castle is open. There's soup

738
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,000
[] and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

739
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,290
Here. Pass these out.

740
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,000
Prince Hans, are we just

741
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,760
expected to sit here and freeze

742
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,130
while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?

743
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,720
Princess Anna has given her orders and...

744
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,340
And that's another thing

745
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,260
has it dawned on you that your Princess

746
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,180
may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress...

747
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,390
to destroy us all?

748
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,890
Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge

749
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,390
and I will not hesitate to

750
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,850
protect Arendelle from treason.

751
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,140
Treason?!

752
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,070
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

753
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,490
Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?

754
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,530
Princess Anna is in trouble.

755
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,370
I need volunteers to go with me to find her!

756
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,790
I volunteer two men, my Lord!

757
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,790
Be prepared for anything

758
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,120
and should you encounter the Queen

759
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,670
you are to put an end to this winter.

760
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,630
Do you understand?

761
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,550
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

762
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,430
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

763
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,470
That's your plan? My ice business is

764
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,560
riding on you talking to your sister.

765
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,230
Yup.

766
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,270
So you're not at all afraid of her?

767
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,100
-- - Why would I be? - Yeah.

768
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,190
I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest

769
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,190
warmest person ever.

770
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,940
Oh, look at that.

771
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,570
I've been impaled.

772
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,030
What now?

773
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,660
It's too steep. I've only got one rope

774
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,410
and you don't know how to climb mountains.

775
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,250
Says who?

776
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,870
What are you doing?

777
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,870
I'm going to see my sister.

778
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You're going to kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there.

779
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,880
-- - You're distracting me... - Or there.

780
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,050
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

781
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,760
I'm just blocking you out 'cause

782
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,800
I gotta concentrate here.

783
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,220
You know, most people who disappear

784
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,930
into the mountains want to be alone.

785
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,480
Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you.

786
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,020
I'm not alone... I have friends, remember?

787
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,730
You mean the love experts?

788
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,860
Yes, the love experts!

789
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,360
Please tell me I'm almost there.

790
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,780
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

791
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,570
- - Hang on. - Hey, Sven?

792
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,120
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found

793
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,580
a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.

794
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,750
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

795
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,620
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.

796
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,560
Now that's ice. I might cry.

797
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,970
Go ahead. I won't judge.

798
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,520
All right, take it easy boy. Come here, I gotcha.

799
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,480
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

800
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,700
Flawless.

801
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,450
Knock... just knock...

802
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,910
Why isn't she knocking?

803
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,120
Do you think she knows how to knock?

804
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,710
It opened. That's a first.

805
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,720
You should probably wait out here.

806
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,260
What?

807
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,220
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.

808
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,800
But. But... oh come on, It's a palace made of ice.

809
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,100
-- - Ice is my life. - Bye, Sven.

810
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,060
You too, Olaf.

811
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,350
-- - Me? - Just give us a minute.

812
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,730
Okay.

813
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,110
One... two... three... four...

814
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,870
Elsa? It's me... Anna.

815
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,910
Anna?

816
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,340
Wow... Elsa, you look different...

817
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,090
It's a good different... and this place.

818
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,510
-- - Is amazing. - Thank you.

819
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,300
I never knew what I was capable of.

820
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,640
... I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known...

821
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,100
No, it's okay.

822
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,850
You don't have to apologize.

823
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,600
But you should probably go, please.

824
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,980
But I just got here.

825
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,860
You belong in Arendelle.

826
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,190
-- - So do you. - No, Anna. I belong here.

827
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,490
Alone.

828
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,900
Where I can be who I am

829
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,030
without hurting anybody.

830
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,660
--585960 - Actually, about that... - 58... 59... 60.

831
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,080
Wait. What is that?

832
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,950
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

833
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,950
Olaf?

834
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,080
You built me. You remember that?

835
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,210
And you're alive?

836
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,670
Um... I think so?

837
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,670
He's just like the one we built as kids.

838
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,590
So we were so close.

839
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
We can be like that again.

840
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,600
Slow down.

841
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,810
Anna!

842
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,480
No, We can't.

843
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,400
-- - Goodbye, Anna. - Elsa, wait.

844
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,900
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

845
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,570
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

846
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,570
Please don't shut me out again.

847
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,570
Please don't slam the door.

848
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,490
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

849
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,620
'Cause for the first time in forever

850
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,960
I finally understand

851
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,420
For the first time in forever, we can fix this hand in hand

852
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,670
We can head down this mountain together

853
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,710
You don't have to live in fear

854
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,590
'Cause for the first time in forever

855
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,180
I will be right here

856
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,140
Anna, please go back home

857
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,180
Your life awaits.

858
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,350
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates

859
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,930
-- - Yeah, but... - I know! You mean well

860
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,400
But leave me be.

861
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,480
Yes, I'm alone. But I'm alone and free.

862
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,530
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

863
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,490
-- - Actually, we're not - What do you mean you're not

864
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,120
I get the feeling you don't know

865
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,870
What do I not know

866
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:53,120
Arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow

867
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,330
What?

868
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:59,420
You kind of set off an eternal winter... everywhere.

869
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,830
Everywhere?

870
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,000
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

871
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,170
No, I can't.

872
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,960
-- - I don't know how. - Sure you can.

873
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,340
I know you can!

874
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,470
'Cause for the first time in forever

875
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,010
I'm such a fool! I can't be free

876
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,560
You don't have to be afraid

877
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,060
No escape from the storm inside of me

878
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,230
We can work this out together

879
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,100
I can't control the curse

880
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,820
We'll reverse the storm you've made

881
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,520
Anna, please, You'll only make it worse

882
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,440
Don't panic

883
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,730
There's so much fear

884
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:33,440
We'll make the sun shine bright

885
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,530
You're not safe here

886
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,450
We can face this thing together

887
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,040
I can't

888
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,000
Anna. Are you okay?

889
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,170
-- - I'm okay. I'm fine. - Who's this?

890
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,260
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just... you have to go.

891
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,260
No, I know we can figure this out together.

892
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,600
How? What power do you have to stop this winter?

893
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,970
To stop me?

894
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,350
Anna, I think we should go.

895
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,680
No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

896
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,060
Yes, you are.

897
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,030
Stop. Put us down!

898
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,700
Go away!

899
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,740
Heads up!

900
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,580
Watch out for my butt!

901
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,200
It is not nice to throw people!

902
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,040
Wow, wow, wow feisty pants. Ok, relax.

903
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,790
Just calm down. Calm down.

904
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,710
All Right. I'm Okay.

905
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,920
Just let the snow man be.

906
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,420
-- - I'm calm. - Great.

907
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,920
Come on!

908
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,800
See. Now you made him mad!

909
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,840
I'll distract him.

910
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
You guys go.

911
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,140
No, no, not you guys.

912
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,680
This just got a whole lot harder.

913
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,490
What are you doing?

914
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,370
I got him!

915
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,660
It's a hundred foot drop.

916
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,290
It's two hundred.

917
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,210
-- - What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.

918
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,540
Okay. What if we fall?

919
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,460
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there.

920
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,380
It'll be like landing on a pillow...

921
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,050
hopefully.

922
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,340
Okay, Anna. On three.

923
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,510
-- - One... - Okay. You tell me when...

924
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,640
-- - Two... - I'm ready to go... I was born ready! Yes!

925
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,100
Calm down.

926
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,810
Tree!

927
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:02,890
... What the... Whoa! That happened.

928
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,860
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

929
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,610
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

930
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,700
Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost marshmallow back there!

931
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,120
Hey. We were just talking about you.

932
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,870
All good things, all good things.

933
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,240
No!

934
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,210
This is not making much of a difference! Is it?

935
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,000
Olaf!

936
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,750
-- - Hang in there, guys! - Go faster!

937
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,130
Wait, what?

938
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,850
Kristoff!

939
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,390
Don't come back!

940
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,140
We won't.

941
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,150
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

942
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,150
Olaf!

943
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,610
I can't feel my legs!

944
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,450
Those are my legs.

945
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,370
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

946
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,580
Oh, that feels better.

947
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,200
Hey, Sven! He found us.

948
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,290
Who's my cute little reindeer?

949
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,330
Don't talk to him like that.

950
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,710
Here.

951
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,710
-- - You okay? - Thank you.

952
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,970
Um... how's your head?

953
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,720
I mean, It's fine. Ah... I'm good.

954
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,220
Ha. I've got a thick skull.

955
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,970
I don't have a skull... or bones.

956
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,980
So...

957
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,480
-- - So now what? - Now what?

958
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,440
Now what?!

959
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,650
Oooh! What am I gonna do?

960
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,650
She threw me out. I can't go back to

961
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,650
Arendelle with the weather like this.

962
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,610
... And then there's your ice business...

963
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,150
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business.

964
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,860
-- - Worry about your hair. - What?

965
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,820
Just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.

966
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,990
No, yours is turning white.

967
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,160
White? It's... what?

968
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,870
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

969
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,870
Does it look bad?

970
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,250
-- - No. - You hesitated.

971
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,670
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Okay? Come on.

972
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,050
-- - Okay! Where are we going? - To see my friends.

973
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,880
-- - The love experts? - Love experts?!

974
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,340
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

975
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,300
How do you know?

976
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,970
Because I've seen them do it before.

977
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:34,810
I like to consider myself a love expert.

978
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,390
Get it together. Control it.

979
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:46,690
Don't feel. Don't feel.

980
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,770
Don't feel!

981
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,870
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

982
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:11,170
-- - Are you cold? - A little.

983
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,670
Wait. Come here.

984
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,550
So, about my friends...

985
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,100
Well, I say friends, they're more like family.

986
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,010
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven

987
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,430
until you know, they took us in.

988
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,850
-- - They did? - Yeah.

989
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,640
I don't want to scare you, they can be

990
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,440
a little bit inappropriate.

991
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,860
And loud... very loud...

992
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,230
They're also stubborn at times, and a little

993
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:47,490
... overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. Which you...

994
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,490
But you know, you're okay. They're fine. They mean well.

995
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,910
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

996
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,160
Okay then.

997
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,710
Meet my family.

998
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,370
Hey, guys!

999
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,960
They're rocks.

1000
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,670
He's crazy.

1001
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,760
Hey, Wow... I pretty recognize you, What's so much weigh?

1002
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,090
I'll distract them while you run.

1003
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:20,850
Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!

1004
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,680
Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.

1005
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,480
I understand you're love experts!

1006
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,020
Why aren't you running?

1007
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,440
... Okay. Um... I'm gonna go...

1008
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,900
No, no, no. Anna, wait!

1009
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,530
Kristoff!

1010
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,030
Kristoff's home!

1011
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,120
Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long!

1012
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,200
Kristoff's home!

1013
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,120
Wait? Kristoff?

1014
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,000
Yeah... Oh, let me look at you!

1015
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,750
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff, I wash them.

1016
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,380
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on. Look.

1017
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,040
it's great to see you all.

1018
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,340
-- - But where's Grand Pabbie? - He's napping.

1019
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,090
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1020
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,800
And I earned my fire crystal.

1021
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,260
I passed a kidney stone.

1022
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,680
Kristoff, pick me up.

1023
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,340
You're getting big! Good for you.

1024
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,850
Trolls? They're trolls.

1025
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:20,140
He's brought a girl!

1026
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,140
She's like a little cupcake.

1027
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,150
What's going on?

1028
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,480
I've learned to just roll with it.

1029
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,070
Let me see.

1030
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,110
Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth.

1031
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,570
Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1032
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,400
Wait. Oh, no.

1033
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,350
You've got the wrong idea.

1034
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,070
That's not why I brought her here.

1035
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,370
... Right. We're not. I'm not...

1036
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,330
What's the issue, dear?

1037
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,490
Why are you holding back from such a man?

1038
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:44,580
Is it the clumpy way he walks

1039
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,700
What?

1040
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,030
Or the grumpy way he talks

1041
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,870
No.

1042
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,580
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

1043
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,410
weirdness of his feet

1044
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,250
Hey!

1045
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,500
And though we know he washes well

1046
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,880
he always ends up sorta smelly

1047
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,880
But you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet

1048
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,630
... That's nice, but...

1049
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,640
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1050
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,720
So he's got a few flaws

1051
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,660
His peculiar brain, dear

1052
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,970
His thing for the reindeer

1053
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,040
That outside a few of nature's laws

1054
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,390
This is not about me!

1055
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,560
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1056
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,810
But this we're certain of

1057
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,440
You can fix this fixer upper up

1058
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,150
with a little bit of love

1059
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,650
Can we just stop talking about this?!

1060
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,860
We've got a real, actual problem here.

1061
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,060
I'll say...so tell me dear.

1062
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,570
Is it the way that he runs scared

1063
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,870
Or that he's socially impaired

1064
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:34,030
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods

1065
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,160
I do not need to know that.

1066
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,580
Are you holding back your fondness

1067
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,080
Due to his unmanly blondeness

1068
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Or the way he covers up

1069
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,830
that he's the honest goods

1070
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,460
He's just a bit of a fixer upper

1071
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,170
He's got a couple a' bugs

1072
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,170
No, I don't.

1073
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,340
His isolation is confirmation of

1074
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,420
his desperation for healing hugs

1075
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,680
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1076
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,140
But we know what to do

1077
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,300
The way to fix up this fixer upper

1078
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,180
is to fix him up with you

1079
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,730
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

1080
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,600
She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!

1081
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,520
So she's a bit of a fixer upper

1082
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,230
That's a minor thing

1083
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,690
This quote engagement is a flex arrangement

1084
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,400
And by the way, I don't see no ring

1085
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,410
So she's a bit of a fixer upper

1086
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,410
Her brain's a bit betwixt

1087
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,660
Get the fiance out of the way

1088
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,870
and the whole thing will be fixed

1089
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,960
We aren't saying you can change him

1090
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,040
'Cause people don't really change

1091
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,040
We're only saying that love's a force

1092
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,300
That's powerful and strange

1093
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,010
People make bad choices

1094
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,430
if they're mad or scared or stressed

1095
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,840
But throw a little love their way

1096
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,300
throw a little love their way

1097
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,550
And you'll bring out their best

1098
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,810
True love brings out the best

1099
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,310
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper

1100
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,190
That's what it's all about

1101
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,000
Father, sister, brother

1102
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,310
We need each other

1103
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,900
to raise us up and round us out

1104
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,730
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper

1105
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,440
But when push comes to shove

1106
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,900
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is

1107
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:19,240
True, True, True, True, Love

1108
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,700
Love, Love, Love, True Love

1109
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,160
True-e-e-e-e-e

1110
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:24,770
Do you, Anna

1111
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,120
... take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

1112
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,290
Wait, what?!

1113
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,040
You're getting married.

1114
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,040
Anna!

1115
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,170
She's as cold as ice.

1116
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,840
There's strange magic here!

1117
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,640
Grand Pabbie!

1118
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,090
Come, come. Bring her to me.

1119
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,350
Anna, your life is in danger.

1120
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,970
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister.

1121
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,270
If not removed

1122
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,810
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1123
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,480
What? No.

1124
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,270
But you can remove it, right?

1125
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,980
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff.

1126
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,280
If it was her head that would be easy

1127
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,510
but only an act of true love

1128
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:09,490
can thaw a frozen heart.

1129
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,870
An act of true love?

1130
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,660
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1131
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,080
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1132
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,210
Hans.

1133
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,840
Pull us out, Sven.

1134
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,760
-- - Olaf! Come on. - I'm coming!

1135
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,970
Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!

1136
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,560
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1137
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,520
Be on guard

1138
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,190
but no harm is to come to the Queen.

1139
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,150
-- - Do you understand? - Yes, Sir.

1140
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,000
The Queen.

1141
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Go, go!

1142
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Get on!

1143
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,020
Up there! Come on!

1144
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
We got her.

1145
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,640
No, please.

1146
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,480
Stay away!

1147
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,690
Fire! Fire!

1148
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,990
Get her! Get her!

1149
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,450
Queen Elsa!

1150
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,160
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1151
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,490
... No. What... what have I done?

1152
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,750
Why did you bring me here?

1153
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,790
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1154
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,100
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.

1155
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,420
Get Anna.

1156
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,760
Anna has not returned.

1157
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,550
If you would just stop the winter

1158
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:08,180
bring back summer. Please.

1159
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,390
Don't you see? I can't.

1160
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,850
You have to tell them to let me go.

1161
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,230
I will do what I can.

1162
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:48,670
Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster!

1163
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,880
I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1164
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,550
Stay out of sight, Olaf!

1165
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,180
I will!

1166
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,100
It's Princess Anna!

1167
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,490
... Are you g... gonna be okay?

1168
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,070
Don't worry about me.

1169
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,490
Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick...

1170
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,240
My Lady.

1171
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,620
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.

1172
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,660
We will. Thank you.

1173
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,620
Make sure she's safe!

1174
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,760
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

1175
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,810
You cannot risk going out there again.

1176
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:02,930
... If anything happens to her...

1177
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,850
If anything happens to the Princess

1178
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,810
you are all Arendelle has left.

1179
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,860
He's in here. Prince Hans.

1180
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,360
Anna. You're so cold.

1181
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,650
-- - Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?

1182
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,220
Now.

1183
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,360
-- - Now.- Settle down.

1184
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,570
We'll give you two some privacy.

1185
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,610
What happened out there?

1186
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,370
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1187
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,660
You said she'd never hurt you.

1188
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,950
I was wrong.

1189
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:27,950
Anna?

1190
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,390
She froze my heart

1191
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,370
and only an act of true love can save me.

1192
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,830
A true love's kiss.

1193
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,760
Oh, Anna...

1194
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,550
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

1195
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,270
What?

1196
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,520
You said you did.

1197
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,990
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom

1198
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:05,650
I didn't stand a chance.

1199
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,690
... I knew...

1200
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,400
I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere.

1201
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
What are you talking about?

1202
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,650
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1203
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,990
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

1204
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,410
-...- - But you... - Hans?

1205
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,950
You were so desperate for love.

1206
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,540
You were willing to marry me, just like that.

1207
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,980
I figured, after we married

1208
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,960
I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

1209
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,500
Hans. No, stop.

1210
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,720
But then she doomed herself

1211
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,340
and you were dumb enough to go after her.

1212
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,590
Please.

1213
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,830
All that's left now is to kill Elsa

1214
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,340
and bring back summer.

1215
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,010
You're no match for Elsa.

1216
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,640
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1217
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,680
I, on the other hand, am the hero

1218
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,640
who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.

1219
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,810
You won't get away with this.

1220
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,520
Oh, I already have.

1221
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,280
Please, somebody help.

1222
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,830
Please, please!

1223
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,830
It's getting colder by the minute.

1224
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,580
If we don't do something soon

1225
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,750
we'll all freeze to death.

1226
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:22,920
--... - Prince Hans. - Princess Anna is...

1227
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,040
-- - dead. - What...?

1228
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,130
What happened to her?

1229
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,260
She was killed by Queen Elsa.

1230
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,510
Her own sister.

1231
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,390
At least we got to say our marriage vows

1232
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,310
before she died in my arms.

1233
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,100
There can be no doubt now.

1234
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,140
Queen Elsa is a monster

1235
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,780
and we are all in grave danger.

1236
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:56,860
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.

1237
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:59,300
With a heavy heart

1238
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:04,490
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason

1239
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,660
and sentence her to death.

1240
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,960
Hurry up!

1241
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,720
She's dangerous. Move quickly and be careful.

1242
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,720
-- - The door's not open! - It's frozen.

1243
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,740
What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it.

1244
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,330
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,830
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

1246
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,250
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

1247
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:13,000
No, Sven! We're not going back!

1248
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,380
She's with her true love.

1249
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,350
... What the...

1250
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:27,680
Anna!

1251
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,680
Come on! Come on, boy!

1252
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,700
Help.

1253
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,040
Anna. Oh no.

1254
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,180
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

1255
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,680
So this is heat. I love it.

1256
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,640
Ooh! But don't touch it!

1257
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:38,240
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

1258
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,870
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

1259
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,870
But we ran all the way here?

1260
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:46,320
Please Olaf, you can't stay here

1261
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,450
you'll melt.

1262
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:50,220
I am not leaving here

1263
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,410
until we find some other act of true love to save you.

1264
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,710
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1265
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,710
I don't even know what love is.

1266
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,590
That's okay, I do.

1267
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,630
... Love is...

1268
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,420
putting someone else's needs before yours

1269
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,220
like, you know

1270
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:06,010
how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans

1271
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,260
and left you forever.

1272
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,970
Kristoff loves me?

1273
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:18,180
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

1274
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:19,270
Olaf, you're melting.

1275
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:22,270
Some people are worth melting for.

1276
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,110
Just maybe not right this second.

1277
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,030
Don't worry, I've got it!

1278
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,450
... We're going to get through...

1279
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:40,240
Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.

1280
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,110
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1281
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,460
They're coming back this way.

1282
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:47,330
They... they are?

1283
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,660
Wow, he's really moving fast.

1284
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,790
I guess I was wrong.

1285
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:53,750
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.

1286
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,050
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1287
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:56,720
No, no, no, no, no.

1288
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,180
You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.

1289
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,090
-- - I need to get to Kristoff. - Why?

1290
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:05,100
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

1291
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,430
There's your act of true love right there

1292
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,890
riding across the fjords like a valiant

1293
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,500
pungent reindeer King!

1294
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,390
Come on!

1295
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,650
Look out!

1296
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,570
Back this way!

1297
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,950
We're trapped.

1298
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,720
Slide, Anna.

1299
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,980
We made it!

1300
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,850
Go, Go, Go, Go...

1301
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,200
Come on, buddy, faster.

1302
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,040
Kristoff!

1303
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
Keep going!

1304
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,920
Kristoff!

1305
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,920
... No...

1306
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,170
Sven!

1307
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,390
Good boy.

1308
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,980
Kristoff.

1309
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,070
Anna!

1310
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,280
Elsa.

1311
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:09,030
You can't run from this!

1312
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:14,290
-- - Just take care of my sister. - Your sister?

1313
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,870
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

1314
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,500
She said you froze her heart.

1315
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:23,460
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1316
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,340
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

1317
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,760
Your sister is dead... because of you.

1318
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,760
No!

1319
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,110
Kristoff?

1320
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,780
Anna!

1321
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,710
Elsa?

1322
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,260
No!

1323
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,980
Anna!

1324
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:43,360
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.

1325
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,190
Anna.

1326
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,780
Anna?

1327
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,320
Anna?

1328
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,610
Oh, Elsa.

1329
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,820
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1330
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,780
I love you.

1331
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:51,080
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.

1332
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,200
... Love will thaw...

1333
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:57,660
Love. Of course.

1334
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,710
- - - Elsa? - Love.

1335
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:49,120
I knew you could do it.

1336
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,960
Hands down, this is the best day of my life

1337
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,540
and quite possibly the last.

1338
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,050
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

1339
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,880
Hey, my own personal flurry.

1340
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:17,100
Anna? But she froze your heart.

1341
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,560
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

1342
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
Fantastic!

1343
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,130
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1344
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,250
We shall see

1345
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:51,040
what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.

1346
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,710
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

1347
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,420
This is unacceptable.

1348
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:56,630
I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

1349
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:59,550
I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts.

1350
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:02,760
Is there a doctor I could see? No.

1351
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,510
I demand to see the Queen!

1352
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:08,180
I have a message from the Queen.

1353
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:09,940
Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1354
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:14,250
no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown.

1355
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:16,940
Weselton. It's Weselton!

1356
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:18,640
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

1357
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,690
Ow, Okay, Okay, here I come.

1358
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:23,110
-...- - Pole... - Oops. So Sorry.

1359
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,450
Okay. Okay. Here we are.

1360
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,910
I owe you a sled.

1361
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:35,040
Are you serious?

1362
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,660
Yes. And it's the latest model.

1363
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,750
No. I can't accept this.

1364
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,790
You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1365
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,760
She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1366
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,800
-- - What? That's not a thing. - Sure it is.

1367
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,260
And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it?

1368
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:53,760
Like it? I love it!

1369
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,300
I could kiss you!

1370
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:59,220
... I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd...

1371
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:00,440
...... May I? We me...

1372
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,310
I mean, may we?

1373
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:03,100
Wait, what?

1374
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,190
We may.

1375
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:10,320
Summer!

1376
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:16,030
Hello.

1377
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:34,630
Are you ready?

1378
01:31:58,190 --> 01:31:59,810
I like the open gates.

1379
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:02,190
We are never closing them again.

1380
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:06,110
Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful

1381
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:07,610
... but you know I don't ska...

1382
01:32:07,610 --> 01:32:09,570
Come on, you can do it!

1383
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,780
Look out! The reindeer is coming through!

1384
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,780
I don't got it. I don't got it!

1385
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,700
Hey, guys!

1386
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:15,700
Olaf!
