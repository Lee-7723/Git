00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:24,572
Mm-mmm.

3
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:03,482
You're alive.

4
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,842
What are you dreaming,little angel?

5
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:19,042
Well...

6
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:25,412
Try again.

7
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:27,682
Well, that's the bestI can do for now.

8
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:28,782
I'm really grateful, Doc.

9
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,722
I'll be getting some overtimenext week.

10
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:31,992
Yeah, pay me when you can.

11
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,862
Here,I got these for you.

12
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,792
My wife works outat Farm 22.

13
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:38,162
Thank you.

14
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:40,602
See you next time.

15
00:05:41,502 --> 00:05:42,562
Keep getting paid in fruit

16
00:05:42,572 --> 00:05:44,532
and we'll be pickingthese ourselves.

17
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,612
Hello, sleepyhead.

18
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:52,842
Hi.

19
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:55,552
How do you feel?

20
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:58,682
Okay.

21
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,552
Any pain anywhere?

22
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:02,122
No.

23
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:04,822
- Numbness?- No.

24
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,792
Motor dysfunction?

25
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:10,792
I'm a little hungry.

26
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,762
Eat this.

27
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,262
Get your sugar levels up.

28
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,112
Taste receptors are working.

29
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,772
Thank you.

30
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:30,212
You'll like this a whole lotbetter with the peel off.

31
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:33,582
I don't mean to be rude...

32
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,692
but am I supposedto know you?

33
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:37,682
Actually...

34
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:39,192
we haven't met.

35
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:42,722
I'm Dr. Dyson Ido.This is Nurse Gerhad.

36
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:47,062
And do you know who I am?

37
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:51,102
Well, we were hoping...

38
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:52,902
you'd fill in that part.

39
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:55,172
Since you'rea total replacement cyborg...

40
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,342
and most of your cyber bodywas destroyed...

41
00:06:58,342 --> 00:06:59,972
we can't find any records.

42
00:06:59,982 --> 00:07:04,652
But your very human brain was miraculously intact.

43
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:08,512
Theoretically, you should remember something.

44
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:10,992
Oh. Well...

45
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,092
It's still pretty blank.

46
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:18,632
No, it's completely blank,actually.

47
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,702
I don't even know my own name.

48
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:31,772
Let's look at the bright side.

49
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:34,982
Your tears are working.

50
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,622
Mmm.

51
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:50,962
That's so good.

52
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,702
What do you call this?

53
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:21,452
Yeow! What's that?

54
00:08:21,462 --> 00:08:23,322
- Zalem.- Oh!

55
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,732
The last ofthe great sky cities.

56
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:31,032
- What holds it up? Magic?- No.

57
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:34,102
Something stronger.Engineering.

58
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:43,282
And down here,we have Iron City.

59
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:44,742
With all its charm.

60
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:48,182
Dr. Dyson Ido. That's you.

61
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:51,292
While I'm learning names,do you have one for me?

62
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,322
Alita.

63
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:59,032
It's a nice name.

64
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:01,302
I love it.

65
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,232
Can I keep it?

66
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,772
At least until I can remember my real name?

67
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:07,402
- Mm-hmm.- Thank you.

68
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:10,542
Okay.

69
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,242
- Do you want to take a look?- Yes.

70
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:19,952
Why are there so many languages?

71
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:22,212
Um, after the big war I told you about...

72
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:23,122
The Fall.

73
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:25,822
After The Fall,only Zalem was left...

74
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:28,922
and survivors came here from all over the world.

75
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:32,362
Everybody down here works for Zalem.

76
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,532
The Factory, the Farms...

77
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,262
Does anyone ever go up to Zalem?

78
00:09:36,262 --> 00:09:37,132
We should go.

79
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,072
Nobody from down here ever goes up.

80
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:40,802
It's a rule that's never broken.

81
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:42,672
What?

82
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:50,542
Oh!And he takes him down hard!

83
00:09:50,552 --> 00:09:52,052
What is that?

84
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:54,722
It's Motor ball.

85
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:56,652
That's so cool.

86
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:59,992
Nothing you need to be wasting your time watching.

87
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:18,812
Alita.

88
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:21,282
One minute, please.

89
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,282
Hi.

90
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,122
Hello.

91
00:10:32,662 --> 00:10:34,252
You want some?

92
00:10:34,262 --> 00:10:35,322
Here you go.

93
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,332
Can I hug you?

94
00:10:40,632 --> 00:10:41,832
Hi.

95
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:04,682
Step aside.

96
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:07,022
Out of the way.

97
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:22,202
Outstanding.

98
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,412
Why don't you watch where you're going?

99
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:31,442
I gotta admit...

100
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,382
I never saw anybody challenge a Centurion before.

101
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,222
Whoa. You're heavy.

102
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:40,962
I mean...

103
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:42,962
Oh.

104
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:44,462
You're a cyborg.

105
00:11:46,632 --> 00:11:48,502
Sorry, I was just admiring your hand.

106
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,002
Can I see?

107
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,212
Wow.

108
00:11:59,772 --> 00:12:01,212
It's really nice work.

109
00:12:02,882 --> 00:12:04,152
Did Doc Ido do it?

110
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,512
He built all of me.

111
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:09,582
Except my core. That's mine.

112
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:12,152
Well, he did a really great job.

113
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,222
Hey, what are those things?

114
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,432
The Centurions?

115
00:12:18,262 --> 00:12:20,532
What planet are you from?

116
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,762
Ido found me in the Scrapyard.

117
00:12:22,762 --> 00:12:24,732
- The Scrapyard?- Mm-hmm.

118
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,672
But that would mean...

119
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,932
Hey, Doc.

120
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,272
I got those driver-boards you were looking for.

121
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:32,772
Alita is new here.

122
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,672
She's still learning about things.

123
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:35,812
I gotta go.

124
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,142
I'll drop those off later.

125
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,982
I need a rebuild on a quad servo.

126
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,552
Maybe I'll see you around.

127
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,122
Who is that?

128
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,962
Hugo.

129
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:51,122
He's a hard worker, but...

130
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,292
Alita, come on,let's go home.

131
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,202
- Hugo.- Let's go home.

132
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,482
There's the damn Jackers

133
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,112
that ripped me to shreds standing right there.

134
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:24,982
And that vale madre Centurionwouldn't lift a finger.

135
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,522
Why would anyone wanna take your arms and legs?

136
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,522
Torque coupling.

137
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:33,562
Those Jackers want your parts for the black market.

138
00:14:34,602 --> 00:14:36,332
To supply the Motorball games.

139
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:38,062
You were lucky.

140
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:41,202
Another girl was murdered last night, right near there.

141
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:44,742
Yeah, I heard that guy carves girls up...

142
00:14:44,742 --> 00:14:46,412
and sells their body parts.

143
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,282
Sorry, Doc.

144
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:53,882
For now, I don't want you out after dark.

145
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:55,212
Is that understood?

146
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:56,352
Okay.

147
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:58,652
And if you go out during the day

148
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,792
don't wander too far from this neighborhood.

149
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:01,892
Okay.

150
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:02,952
Promise?

151
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,332
I promise.

152
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:16,742
Hey, kid.

153
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,522
Hey, what's your problem?

154
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,742
Who's the girl?

155
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,312
My new assistant.

156
00:15:53,472 --> 00:15:56,712
I was surprised to see her in our daughter's body.

157
00:15:56,712 --> 00:15:59,412
You were supposed to have destroyed that years ago.

158
00:16:01,922 --> 00:16:04,152
- I couldn't.- Clearly.

159
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:08,722
And did you tell her who you built that body for?

160
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:14,962
Our daughter is dead, Chiren.

161
00:16:14,962 --> 00:16:16,802
- You need to let it go.- Oh.

162
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:19,842
It's obviously not me that's clinging to something here.

163
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:35,682
Over here!

164
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,302
- Hugo.- Hey, Alita.

165
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,802
Is this Motorball?

166
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,732
It's just a scrimmage.

167
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:55,102
Do you wanna join in?

168
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,672
Come on, every kid's gotta play Motorball.

169
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,472
Sure, why not?

170
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:04,352
I want usto be a team again.

171
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,422
I have a great new setup...

172
00:17:08,252 --> 00:17:10,122
and equipment...

173
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:11,792
worthy of your skills.

174
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:15,292
Together, we can build the finest champions

175
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,762
this game has ever seen.

176
00:17:17,692 --> 00:17:19,222
Could be my ticket home.

177
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:22,262
When are you going to realize there is no way back?

178
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:23,902
It just does not happen.

179
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,062
Vector can make it happen.

180
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:27,032
I can't believe you trust Vector.

181
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,372
He has very high connections.

182
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:33,642
I won't help you build monsters.

183
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:43,552
I'm going to get back to Zalem somehow.

184
00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:47,922
I'll claw my way there with my bare hands if I have to.

185
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,882
Hey, everyone,this is Alita.

186
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:11,842
Hi.

187
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,682
Best way to learn is to go in.

188
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:30,702
Pass the ball!

189
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:31,832
That's it.

190
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,702
Lean into your turns,look for an opening.

191
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:36,812
I think I'm getting it!

192
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:44,612
You can let goof the remote now.

193
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:47,922
Oh, crap.

194
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:57,192
- Come on, get her!- Come on, get her!

195
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,292
Cut her off!

196
00:18:58,292 --> 00:18:59,702
Koyomi, pass her the ball.

197
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:02,432
And she got it! She got it!

198
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,532
Get her!

199
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:12,472
Sorry, princess.

200
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,912
Nice, Tanji, thanks.

201
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,782
She's never played before.

202
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:22,452
Sorry.

203
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:35,862
Got this!

204
00:19:35,862 --> 00:19:36,862
Mine!

205
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:45,712
You got me!

206
00:20:02,022 --> 00:20:03,022
Good shot.

207
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:10,962
Your freak girl friend's got some serious malfunctions.

208
00:20:10,972 --> 00:20:12,562
I'm really sorry.

209
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:14,372
She humiliated you so severely.

210
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:18,372
All right,I'll see you tonight.

211
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,982
And, uh,she's not my girlfriend.

212
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:23,712
Whatever.

213
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,592
You've got some talent for this game.

214
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:34,922
I've got to get home now.

215
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:37,062
Ido wants me in the house before dark.

216
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,832
Do you want a ride?

217
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,272
So you can't remember anything?

218
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:50,572
I'm trying to.

219
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:53,712
Family, friends,favorite food?

220
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,242
Nothing. Well, maybe oranges.

221
00:20:56,242 --> 00:20:57,612
But that's just since yesterday.

222
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:59,512
- Oranges?- Uh-huh.

223
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:01,552
Nope. Unacceptable.

224
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:04,452
Here, check this out.

225
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,052
Thank you very much, Senora.

226
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:12,062
And here you go.

227
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,192
Thank you.

228
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:14,662
You ready?

229
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:15,662
Try this.

230
00:21:16,032 --> 00:21:17,032
Trust me.

231
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:19,632
It's chocolate.

232
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:25,702
Mmm.

233
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,742
- That is so great.- It's good, right?

234
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:31,542
I have a favorite food now.

235
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:32,782
- Thank you.- This is my favorite food.

236
00:21:32,782 --> 00:21:34,052
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

237
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,112
I would.

238
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:37,092
Hey, look. Check it out.

239
00:21:38,052 --> 00:21:39,482
It's a Hunter-Warrior.

240
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:43,022
He's a bounty hunter. Named Zapan.

241
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,732
Scanning for his mark.

242
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:48,102
I wouldn't wanna be that guy.

243
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:51,602
Look at that sword.

244
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:54,602
All guns are out lawed in Iron City.

245
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,012
Punishable by death.

246
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:01,542
Anything that challenges Zalem.

247
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:29,102
Didn't I tell you to be homebe fore dark?

248
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:32,572
What's the big deal?I just lost track of time.

249
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:35,912
Yeah. Don't trust anyone.

250
00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:38,782
People do terrible things to each other here.

251
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:41,212
What happened to your arm?

252
00:22:41,222 --> 00:22:42,452
Here, eat this.

253
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:43,722
You okay?

254
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:52,232
You still need proper nourishment for your brain.

255
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:56,902
You have any chocolate?

256
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:03,602
It's a harsh world.

257
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:06,312
The strong prey on the weak down here.

258
00:23:06,312 --> 00:23:08,512
You gotta stay focused on your dream.

259
00:23:09,442 --> 00:23:11,182
What's your dream?

260
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,782
I'll show you.

261
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,542
This is my secret place.

262
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:36,942
Best view in town.

263
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,512
Wow.

264
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,212
Really cool.

265
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,622
No. Look.

266
00:23:48,322 --> 00:23:49,622
That view.

267
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:51,922
Oh.

268
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:53,822
Right.

269
00:23:59,592 --> 00:24:01,802
I wonder what it's like up there.

270
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:06,272
Better than this dump down here.

271
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:10,272
Listen.

272
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:16,142
It's stuff from the Factory going up to Zalem.

273
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:21,122
But the tubes are just for cargo, not for people.

274
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:23,882
If I was as strong as you

275
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:26,352
I'd climb that tube to Zalem right now.

276
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:27,922
They don't let anybody up there.

277
00:24:27,922 --> 00:24:30,392
Yeah, that's what they want you to think.

278
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,492
You just gotta know the right people.

279
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,832
- I happen to be connected.- Oh.

280
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:40,002
You gotta be willing to do what it takes.

281
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,742
Whatever it takes.

282
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:49,782
Funny thing is,you've seen it.

283
00:24:50,312 --> 00:24:52,012
You just can't remember.

284
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:53,952
What do you mean?

285
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,322
Doc found you in the Scrapyard.

286
00:25:00,052 --> 00:25:02,962
All that stuff is dumped from Zalem.

287
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:05,792
So you must be from up there.

288
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:12,632
I guess so.

289
00:25:13,802 --> 00:25:16,302
If you could just tell me what those eyes have seen.

290
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:17,702
I wish I could.

291
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:19,912
I keep trying to remember, but...

292
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:23,842
It's still a blank.

293
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:26,252
I'm starting to feel like I wasn't very important.

294
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,812
Just an insignificant girl

295
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:31,052
thrown out with the rest of the garbage.

296
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:15,292
- No! Stop!- Alita!

297
00:27:15,292 --> 00:27:16,292
Don't do it!

298
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,232
Oh, no.

299
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,522
It's a trap.

300
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:24,262
Looking for me, Doctor?

301
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:28,772
Or should I say,Hunter-Warrior?

302
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,202
"Hunter-Warrior"?

303
00:27:34,742 --> 00:27:36,772
Oh, no.

304
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:39,812
Looks like he's got us.

305
00:27:41,822 --> 00:27:43,222
Don't move.

306
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:47,022
Hey, thanks for bringing a girl.

307
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:49,222
That's gonna save us some time.

308
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:06,772
Nice shot, for a Meat-Boy.

309
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:18,122
No!

310
00:28:19,722 --> 00:28:21,892
You came to rescue me?

311
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:25,432
That is so sweet.

312
00:28:28,002 --> 00:28:29,832
You have nice eyes.

313
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:33,032
He's mine.You can have the girl.

314
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:37,572
So long as I get his eyes.

315
00:28:37,572 --> 00:28:38,572
Alita, run!

316
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,222
My God.

317
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:01,302
Rip that flea!

318
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,272
You are so beautiful.

319
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:15,112
I wanna rip you open and see if you're ugly inside.

320
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:18,352
Like the others.

321
00:29:37,502 --> 00:29:39,172
Watch her die.

322
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:25,112
Come here, little flea...

323
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,512
so I can pinch your head off.

324
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,072
Hi-yah!

325
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,312
99!

326
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:57,512
On your left!

327
00:31:02,722 --> 00:31:04,252
Hi-yah!

328
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:19,532
You'll pay, little flea.

329
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,342
Grewishka does not forget.

330
00:31:22,002 --> 00:31:23,372
I'm coming for you.

331
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:27,412
Both.

332
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:38,322
Grewishka does not forget!

333
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:44,622
When I was fighting,I remembered something.

334
00:31:44,632 --> 00:31:46,562
I was in a huge battle.

335
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:48,162
You surprised me.

336
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:50,062
Well,you surprised me, too.

337
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,432
Before The Fall...

338
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:57,072
there were police to stop criminals.

339
00:31:57,072 --> 00:32:00,412
Now, the Factory pays us to do the dirty work.

340
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,112
Hunter-Warrior 17739.

341
00:32:05,752 --> 00:32:07,682
You are a Hunter-Warrior.

342
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:13,422
You stay here.

343
00:32:14,222 --> 00:32:15,662
Don't kill anyone.

344
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:50,062
Bounty for the cyborg Nyssiana was 20,000 credits.

345
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,962
You should've told me who you really are.

346
00:32:56,962 --> 00:32:58,932
And do you do it for the money?

347
00:32:58,932 --> 00:33:01,272
I take the money.

348
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:04,272
Otherwise the clinic would've closed long ago.

349
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:05,842
I do this work for other reasons

350
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:07,112
I'd rather not talk about.

351
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:09,212
You have to talk about it.

352
00:33:09,212 --> 00:33:11,412
Something during the fight triggered a memory.

353
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:14,652
I was on the moon.

354
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:17,282
You know more about me than you're saying.

355
00:33:18,152 --> 00:33:19,852
Whose body is this?

356
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:22,562
Who am I?

357
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:34,672
This was your daughter?

358
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,242
You built this body for her?

359
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,742
Her name was Alita.

360
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:45,842
She was really looking forward to waking up

361
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,482
with legs that could run.

362
00:33:51,282 --> 00:33:53,622
You built her a pair of fast legs.

363
00:33:56,362 --> 00:33:58,562
She never got to use them.

364
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,502
She was murdered.

365
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,402
What happened?

366
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:08,702
A patient of mine came to the clinic one night

367
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:10,202
looking for drugs.

368
00:34:11,412 --> 00:34:13,872
I was a tuner for the Motorball games...

369
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:18,212
and I had made a machine body for him of obscene strength.

370
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:25,452
He was my demon,coming back to me.

371
00:34:25,452 --> 00:34:27,722
Hey! What are you doing there?

372
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,342
Alita couldn't get out of the way fast enough.

373
00:34:46,142 --> 00:34:48,342
Her mother, Chiren,

374
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:50,542
couldn't deal with Alita's death.

375
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:55,822
Maybe she just couldn't deal with me.

376
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:00,752
So I went hunting.

377
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:04,662
I needed to kill him.

378
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:09,962
Maybe I was just hoping that he would kill me.

379
00:35:09,962 --> 00:35:11,902
It brought no peace.

380
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,002
There were other demons like him out there...

381
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:18,412
and I felt, somehow, I was responsible for all of them.

382
00:35:19,512 --> 00:35:21,942
So I registered as a Hunter-Warrior.

383
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:23,952
There's nothing noble about it.

384
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,952
Did you ever find peace?

385
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:31,892
I found you.

386
00:35:34,162 --> 00:35:35,392
I'm not your daughter.

387
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:39,962
I don't know what I am.

388
00:35:41,162 --> 00:35:43,562
I do.

389
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:45,872
Have a look at your original Cyber-core.

390
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,372
This is your brain.

391
00:35:49,372 --> 00:35:52,672
A normal healthy teenage girl's brain.

392
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:55,342
If there is such a thing.

393
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:58,942
But this is your heart.

394
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:01,482
Part of your original core...

395
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:05,622
powered by an Anti-Matter Micro-Reactor.

396
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,452
So I've got a strong heart?

397
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:09,522
You have a heart strong enough

398
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,432
to power all of Iron City for years.

399
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:16,502
This is lost technology.

400
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,702
Nobody's made this stuff since...

401
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:21,132
before The Fall.

402
00:36:21,142 --> 00:36:22,972
Yeah, right.

403
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:25,842
So I'm 300 years old?

404
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:28,742
Sweetheart, you are.

405
00:36:45,562 --> 00:36:48,532
I don't want my players losing unless I tell them to.

406
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:52,402
It can't be left to chance.

407
00:36:52,402 --> 00:36:54,332
You promised me champions.

408
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,202
And you promised me the best of everything.

409
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:59,742
Get those military servos I asked for.

410
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,682
You don't have a winning attitude.

411
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,352
Just be ready for tomorrow's game.

412
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,502
Help me.

413
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:31,942
Grewishka?

414
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:36,012
Why should I waste my talent on you?

415
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:38,012
Look what she's done to me.

416
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:41,752
Ido's little cyber girl.

417
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,992
What did you say?

418
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:55,562
The woman in my memory called me 99.

419
00:37:55,562 --> 00:38:00,172
What you saw was a flash of your previous life.

420
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:01,672
Who was I?

421
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,502
In time, you'll remember.

422
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:50,422
I wanna rip her in half.

423
00:38:51,252 --> 00:38:52,452
Grewishka.

424
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:56,492
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

425
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:59,262
Are we stripping him for parts?

426
00:38:59,262 --> 00:39:00,732
I need you to look at something.

427
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,802
It's a Telepresence Chip.He's wired.

428
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,172
Somebody in Zalem is riding him.

429
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:12,402
There are watchers behind the eyes all over the city.

430
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:13,572
Pretty common now.

431
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:15,182
I'd just as soon remove it...

432
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:17,212
while I'm rebuilding him.

433
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,412
Why are you wasting time

434
00:39:18,412 --> 00:39:20,482
on this burnt-out street junk?

435
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:21,882
It's a personal matter.

436
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:24,682
Do you like your job, Vector?

437
00:39:25,582 --> 00:39:27,422
If you like your position

438
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:29,592
and the many comforts that come with it...

439
00:39:29,592 --> 00:39:33,732
I strongly suggest you listen to Dr. Chiren.

440
00:39:35,762 --> 00:39:36,832
Nova.

441
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:39,532
My apologies.

442
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:42,972
Who did this to Grewishka?

443
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:44,712
A little cyborg girl.

444
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:46,672
Though the impact points

445
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:48,582
are evidence of extraordinary power...

446
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:51,942
I don't understand how she could create

447
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:54,582
such force with such a small body.

448
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:58,182
It was not the power of the body that did this.

449
00:39:58,182 --> 00:39:59,282
It was the mind.

450
00:39:59,292 --> 00:40:03,662
She knows the fighting techniques of Panzer Kunst.

451
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,562
Rebuild Grewishka.

452
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,762
Have him bring her to me.

453
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:09,232
Dead.

454
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:19,012
He's gone.

455
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,082
Not gone.

456
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,742
Repatched.

457
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:28,622
You're a clever woman, Doctor.

458
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:33,292
And determined to reach your goal at any cost.

459
00:40:36,322 --> 00:40:38,692
So I'll make you this offer.

460
00:40:38,692 --> 00:40:41,632
If and when you have pleased me...

461
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:44,532
I will grant you the destiny you seek.

462
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:46,232
Zalem.

463
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,672
You'll send me to Zalem?

464
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:51,672
I'm there right now.

465
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,842
Consider my services engaged.

466
00:41:15,902 --> 00:41:17,892
There is no bounty on Grewishka.

467
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:20,672
But you reported it to the Factory.

468
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:22,402
Him killing all of those women...

469
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:23,972
Somebody's protecting him.

470
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:25,942
Who has the power to do that?

471
00:41:28,242 --> 00:41:30,642
Someone far beyond us here.

472
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:34,982
We better stay off the street for now.

473
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:38,652
I wanna be a Hunter-Warrior like you.

474
00:41:39,452 --> 00:41:41,152
Alita, that's impossible.

475
00:41:41,162 --> 00:41:42,622
We could be a team.

476
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:44,462
Alita, this is dangerous,dirty work.

477
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:46,262
- I know.- No, you don't.

478
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:47,792
How is that your choice to make?

479
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:49,662
It's out of the question.

480
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:51,532
I might need a life-or-death situation

481
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:52,832
to remember who I was.

482
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:54,972
Even if it's just for a second.

483
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,142
Alita, some things are better left forgotten.

484
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:00,072
I don't want blood on these hands, too.

485
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:01,982
Then I'll find out for myself.

486
00:42:02,412 --> 00:42:03,942
Alita.

487
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:10,352
I'm just tired of it.

488
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:13,082
He just wants me to be his perfect little girl.

489
00:42:13,092 --> 00:42:16,152
So, you gonna live by his rules or yours?

490
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:17,322
What a battle!

491
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:20,562
These two have been going at each other all match.

492
00:42:20,562 --> 00:42:22,292
Welcome to Motorball.

493
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:31,272
Jashugan has got the ball.

494
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:34,712
Claymore attacks!

495
00:42:36,582 --> 00:42:38,752
Jashugan takes him out!

496
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:50,892
Masakus sends Jashugan flying!

497
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:55,902
Kutty now with the ball,one point.

498
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:58,932
Zariki is in hot pursuit.

499
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:09,412
- Wipe out, Zariki!- Whoo!

500
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,822
And he throws Kutty like a rag doll!

501
00:43:25,592 --> 00:43:28,132
Come on.Let me show you something.

502
00:43:31,932 --> 00:43:33,772
I know all the pit crews and tuners.

503
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:35,042
I'll introduce you around.

504
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:38,742
Who's the top player?

505
00:43:41,342 --> 00:43:42,342
Right now, I'd say Jashugan

506
00:43:42,342 --> 00:43:44,512
has the best chance of making Final Champion.

507
00:43:44,512 --> 00:43:46,912
Camber's still off in the left bogie.

508
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:49,712
I was oversteering in turn six.

509
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:51,252
What's Final Champion?

510
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:53,982
It's the best thing a Motorball player can win.

511
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:56,922
Every few years, they choose a player that can't be beaten...

512
00:43:56,922 --> 00:43:58,662
and he gets to go to Zalem.

513
00:43:58,662 --> 00:44:00,232
Hey, Hugo.

514
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:03,232
Slow is smooth,smooth is fast.

515
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:04,732
Do it once, do it right.

516
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:06,932
Juggernaut needs to pit,right now.

517
00:44:07,532 --> 00:44:08,972
Do you like to lose?

518
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:10,902
Then get him in here.

519
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:15,812
Claymore is a rebuild.Why is he not tracking?

520
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:20,142
Alita's here.

521
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,752
That's Vector.

522
00:44:21,752 --> 00:44:23,652
He basically runs Motorball.

523
00:44:23,652 --> 00:44:25,722
We do a lot of business with his team.

524
00:44:25,722 --> 00:44:27,522
Selling parts to him and his new tuner.

525
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:28,692
Chiren.

526
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:30,162
Let's go, guys. Come on,get me back out there.

527
00:44:30,162 --> 00:44:32,492
What? You're not the only one with connections.

528
00:44:33,762 --> 00:44:36,332
Kutty closing inon Juggernaut.

529
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:40,532
Kinuba has Kutty in his sights.

530
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:54,682
Oh! Kinuba went through him

531
00:44:54,682 --> 00:44:57,582
like laundry with those Grindcutters.

532
00:44:57,582 --> 00:44:59,522
Is that weapon even legal?

533
00:45:03,692 --> 00:45:05,622
Kinuba's too strong with that new weapon.

534
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:07,532
He's screwing up the odds.

535
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:10,162
You know...

536
00:45:10,162 --> 00:45:12,532
I could really use his Grindcutters...

537
00:45:13,532 --> 00:45:15,102
for our other project.

538
00:45:18,272 --> 00:45:20,472
Crimson Wind making her way through the field.

539
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:21,512
So, what do you think?

540
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,382
I like it.

541
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:30,512
Yo, Hugo. We gotta go.

542
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,152
Hey, something's come up.

543
00:45:32,152 --> 00:45:34,452
- Where are you going?- I just gotta do something.

544
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:36,062
Can you get back okay?

545
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:38,332
Yeah, sure.

546
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:41,392
Can you go out tomorrow?

547
00:45:41,392 --> 00:45:42,992
I wanna show you this place me and Tanji know.

548
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:44,762
It's out in the Badlands.

549
00:45:44,772 --> 00:45:46,272
It might help with your memory.

550
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:48,542
I'd appreciate that.

551
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:50,772
Thanks.

552
00:45:50,772 --> 00:45:52,212
For everything.

553
00:45:54,172 --> 00:45:57,182
Wow!He is throwing down!

554
00:45:59,712 --> 00:46:01,952
Whoo!

555
00:46:08,492 --> 00:46:09,492
Oh, shit!

556
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:11,932
- What the hell?- Shit.

557
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:32,042
Hurry up!

558
00:46:35,382 --> 00:46:36,382
You're dead!

559
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:40,692
You little runts!

560
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:42,322
I'm gonna smash your skulls!

561
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:50,632
You can't do this to me!

562
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:53,372
- Ready.- Give me.

563
00:46:54,872 --> 00:46:56,532
Careful.

564
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:57,402
You street punks!

565
00:46:57,402 --> 00:46:59,472
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

566
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:24,562
Nice work.

567
00:47:25,932 --> 00:47:27,402
Compliments to your crew.

568
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:30,402
Thank you, sir.

569
00:47:33,742 --> 00:47:35,242
I'll pass it on.

570
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:37,712
Hey, man, where's my cut?

571
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:38,882
Hey, when you gonna tell your hard body

572
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:40,212
you jack cyborgs, huh?

573
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:41,612
I'm not.

574
00:47:41,612 --> 00:47:42,952
And neither are you.

575
00:47:42,952 --> 00:47:45,392
You afraid she's gonna cut you loose?

576
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:56,032
Get the Grindcutters over to Chiren right away.

577
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:57,502
Use the service gate.

578
00:47:58,632 --> 00:47:59,632
Go.

579
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:15,982
Vector, you prick.

580
00:48:15,982 --> 00:48:17,452
I should've known.

581
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:19,522
What you should've known,my friend...

582
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:22,122
is that no one...

583
00:48:23,992 --> 00:48:26,092
is greater than the game.

584
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,882
What's outside the city?

585
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:50,012
Not much.

586
00:48:50,022 --> 00:48:51,582
The war wiped out all utilities

587
00:48:51,582 --> 00:48:53,052
and most everything else.

588
00:48:56,692 --> 00:49:01,162
All we know is the sky cities fell all in one night...

589
00:49:01,162 --> 00:49:03,332
when the enemy launched the last attack

590
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,772
with every ship they had.

591
00:49:05,802 --> 00:49:07,272
Who was the enemy?

592
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:09,802
The URM.

593
00:49:09,802 --> 00:49:13,642
United Republics of Mars.The U-R-M.

594
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:15,212
URM.

595
00:49:15,212 --> 00:49:17,812
On that last night of the war...

596
00:49:17,812 --> 00:49:20,482
the earth shook and the sky burned.

597
00:49:20,482 --> 00:49:23,652
But in the morning,Zalem still stood.

598
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:25,622
It's just up ahead.

599
00:49:33,462 --> 00:49:36,192
This ship is from the battle of Zalem.

600
00:49:36,202 --> 00:49:37,362
I figured that maybe seeing stuff

601
00:49:37,362 --> 00:49:39,172
from the war would help trigger your...

602
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:49,012
Salvagers have jacked some stuff

603
00:49:49,012 --> 00:49:50,382
over the years for metal...

604
00:49:51,012 --> 00:49:52,312
but it's all URM technology

605
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:53,612
so it's mostly been left alone.

606
00:49:53,612 --> 00:49:56,052
- This is an URM ship?- Uh-huh.

607
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:57,352
You know, it's pretty hard to sell this stuff

608
00:49:57,352 --> 00:49:59,322
since no one knows what it is...

609
00:49:59,322 --> 00:50:00,422
Shh!

610
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:10,532
We have to goto the command deck.

611
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:14,132
It's forward.

612
00:50:14,902 --> 00:50:16,532
How does she know that?

613
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:19,412
Hey, we can't get there.It's underwater.

614
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:54,612
How long do you think she can hold her breath?

615
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:56,912
I don't know.

616
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:44,682
Oh, this can't be good.

617
00:53:09,612 --> 00:53:10,612
Forget it.

618
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:12,652
I won't do it.

619
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,052
But...

620
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:17,212
But you have to.

621
00:53:17,222 --> 00:53:18,682
This would help us fight Grewishka

622
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:20,822
and anyone else he sends after us.

623
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:23,792
This body...

624
00:53:24,862 --> 00:53:27,422
it has the power I need.

625
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:30,532
I feel a connection to it I can't explain.

626
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:32,362
This could be who I am.

627
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,802
You've been given a chance to start over

628
00:53:34,802 --> 00:53:35,932
with a clean slate.

629
00:53:35,932 --> 00:53:37,272
How many of us get that?

630
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:39,672
Why did an enemy war ship...

631
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:42,812
respond to me?

632
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:44,882
Because I knew that ship.

633
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:47,952
I've been on others like it,haven't I?

634
00:53:49,352 --> 00:53:50,852
Haven't I?

635
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:54,022
Ouf, whatever you were,it's not who you are now.

636
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,522
No!

637
00:53:57,592 --> 00:53:59,592
I'm a warrior, aren't I?

638
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:02,532
And you know.

639
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,962
You've always known.

640
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:11,942
This is called a Berserker.

641
00:54:13,972 --> 00:54:17,912
It's a humanoid weapon-system created by the URM Technology.

642
00:54:18,882 --> 00:54:19,982
Your core

643
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:22,722
was designed to interface with this type of body.

644
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:26,952
Your identity code activated it.

645
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:29,562
The instinctive fighting technique you use...

646
00:54:30,992 --> 00:54:36,192
is Panzer Kunst,a lost combat art for machine bodies.

647
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:38,732
It was used by the Berserkers.

648
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:42,732
This is why you're drawn to conflict without hesitation.

649
00:54:42,732 --> 00:54:44,642
It's part of your training.

650
00:54:44,642 --> 00:54:47,842
You are not justa warrior, Alita.

651
00:54:49,642 --> 00:54:51,672
You're an URM Berserker

652
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:55,652
the most advanced cyborg weapon ever created.

653
00:54:56,312 --> 00:54:57,752
And that is exactly why

654
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,952
I will never unite you with this body.

655
00:55:05,062 --> 00:55:06,432
That's fine.

656
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:09,432
Fine.

657
00:55:37,522 --> 00:55:39,592
State your business.

658
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:42,062
I'm here to register as a Hunter-Warrior.

659
00:55:48,772 --> 00:55:50,472
How'd it go?

660
00:55:55,242 --> 00:55:57,072
You're a Hunter-Warrior,all right.

661
00:55:57,082 --> 00:55:58,512
Doc's gonna be pissed.

662
00:55:58,512 --> 00:56:00,182
Whose rules do I live by?

663
00:56:08,292 --> 00:56:10,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa.Are you sure about this?

664
00:56:10,022 --> 00:56:11,722
This place is just for bounty hunters, nobody else...

665
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:13,362
What do you think this is?

666
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:16,132
Besides, Ido says I'm drawn to conflict.

667
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:21,172
Oh. I remember you.

668
00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:23,502
How's it going, little guy?

669
00:56:23,502 --> 00:56:25,542
Good?

670
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,172
Just watch my back.

671
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,182
Oh, boy.

672
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:50,932
Hey, Zapan!Not the furniture.

673
00:57:00,912 --> 00:57:02,912
What brings you in here, sweets?

674
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:05,942
Come to see the Hunters up close?

675
00:57:05,952 --> 00:57:07,212
Not exactly.

676
00:57:15,322 --> 00:57:17,262
Cup cake here is a bounty hunter.

677
00:57:17,992 --> 00:57:19,692
What?

678
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:22,022
So, you went down

679
00:57:22,032 --> 00:57:24,532
you filled out your application forms...

680
00:57:24,532 --> 00:57:26,002
you got your ID badge...

681
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:28,272
and now you're just like us, yeah?

682
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:30,732
Let me introduce you

683
00:57:30,742 --> 00:57:32,242
to some of your professional colleagues.

684
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:37,212
This is Master Clive Lee of the White Hot Palm.

685
00:57:37,212 --> 00:57:39,652
He has over 200 confirmed kills.

686
00:57:40,482 --> 00:57:42,312
207.

687
00:57:42,312 --> 00:57:44,012
Well, and this is Screwhead

688
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:46,852
one of our most lethal bounty hunters.

689
00:57:48,222 --> 00:57:50,392
And then, there's McTeague...

690
00:57:50,392 --> 00:57:53,422
the Dogmaster,with his Hellhounds.

691
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,432
His biggest problem is having enough left to identify after

692
00:57:56,432 --> 00:57:59,202
so he can collect the bounty.

693
00:58:02,802 --> 00:58:04,672
And then, there's me.

694
00:58:05,372 --> 00:58:07,172
Zapan.

695
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:10,242
Keeper of the legendary Damascus Blade.

696
00:58:11,982 --> 00:58:17,112
Honed to a monomolecular edge.It slices armor like butter.

697
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,522
Forged before The Fall by the lost arts of URM metallurgy.

698
00:58:20,522 --> 00:58:22,692
And who did you kill to acquire it?

699
00:58:27,062 --> 00:58:31,062
A Hunter-Warrior is a solitary predator.

700
00:58:32,102 --> 00:58:35,172
You'll be competing against us for the kill.

701
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,142
You can see what you're up against.

702
00:58:41,642 --> 00:58:42,882
Thanks.

703
00:58:45,812 --> 00:58:48,612
I came to ask for your help...

704
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:52,522
against our common enemy,Grewishka.

705
00:58:52,522 --> 00:58:54,552
He's being protected by the system

706
00:58:54,552 --> 00:58:57,292
and continuesto rampage unchecked.

707
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:00,232
And now,he's after Ido and me.

708
00:59:01,262 --> 00:59:03,492
So I'm calling on you...

709
00:59:03,502 --> 00:59:05,932
my Hunter-Warrior brothers.

710
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:08,702
Let's band together

711
00:59:08,702 --> 00:59:11,642
and defeat him once and for all.

712
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:21,352
Any takers? Hmm?

713
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:23,982
No?

714
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:25,852
Big surprise.

715
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:30,362
You know, normally,I wouldn't take a rookie under my wing...

716
00:59:31,162 --> 00:59:32,892
share my knowledge.

717
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:35,632
I'm willing to make an exception in your case...

718
00:59:35,632 --> 00:59:37,392
if you'll cut loose Meat-Boy over here

719
00:59:37,402 --> 00:59:38,702
and let me buy you a drink.

720
00:59:38,702 --> 00:59:40,332
Hey, watch it.

721
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:45,272
And what could I learn from a loud mouth pretty boy...

722
00:59:45,272 --> 00:59:47,342
who spends all of his money on his face?

723
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:55,712
Maybe I'll pully our arms and legs off

724
00:59:55,712 --> 00:59:58,182
roll your head around in the street.

725
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:00,422
Maybe that'll teach you some manners.

726
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,552
You might mess up your hair.

727
01:00:06,962 --> 01:00:08,232
You gonna take that, Zapan?

728
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:11,762
He's scared of the pretty girl.

729
01:00:12,532 --> 01:00:14,062
Aah!

730
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,862
You do not deserve such a weapon.

731
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:44,232
I heard you were the heroes of Iron City.

732
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,632
I am not impressed.

733
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:49,302
What the hell are you doing?

734
01:00:49,302 --> 01:00:51,302
I'm gonna need you to stand way back.

735
01:00:54,272 --> 01:00:56,982
I will take on anyone in this room.

736
01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:59,942
And if I win...

737
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,952
you fight alongside me.

738
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:06,122
This bitch broke my nose.

739
01:01:06,522 --> 01:01:07,992
Yes, I did.

740
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:11,292
Heroes?

741
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,892
All I see are junkyard punks,assorted cyber-trash...

742
01:01:13,892 --> 01:01:16,462
and a bunch of drunken Motorball burnouts

743
01:01:16,462 --> 01:01:18,232
too slow to play the game.

744
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:01,312
Thanks, Hugo.

745
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:14,022
Oh, no.

746
01:02:27,632 --> 01:02:28,832
Hold it!

747
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,702
Knock it off!

748
01:02:32,702 --> 01:02:34,572
Or no more free repairs!

749
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:47,582
I'm with her.

750
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:49,352
Sorry about this.

751
01:02:51,962 --> 01:02:54,022
You and I are going to have a little talk.

752
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:55,732
No, we had our talk.

753
01:02:55,732 --> 01:02:57,792
You didn't leave me another choice.

754
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:17,922
Don't move.

755
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:31,092
It's Grewishka.

756
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:32,302
What's happened to him?

757
01:03:34,202 --> 01:03:36,102
Well, to answer your question...

758
01:03:41,742 --> 01:03:44,012
I've had a little upgrade.

759
01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:55,222
I'm only here for the girl.

760
01:03:57,462 --> 01:03:58,992
Ah, she's all yours.

761
01:04:03,602 --> 01:04:05,062
What about the rest of you?

762
01:04:05,062 --> 01:04:06,802
There ain't no bounty on this guy, Doc.

763
01:04:08,532 --> 01:04:09,672
Not our problem.

764
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:17,942
It's all right, Ido.

765
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:24,722
Aw.

766
01:04:25,552 --> 01:04:27,492
The only one with courage.

767
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:31,852
So innocent.

768
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:43,302
Iron City is no place for innocents, little flea.

769
01:04:53,142 --> 01:04:57,052
I do not stand by in the presence of evil.

770
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:04,422
I do not stand by in the presence of evil.

771
01:05:21,812 --> 01:05:23,742
Come to my world.

772
01:05:27,852 --> 01:05:29,082
Come, little flea.

773
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:31,782
Alita! No!

774
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:43,592
Welcome to the under world. My world.

775
01:05:43,602 --> 01:05:47,932
From here, there are worlds above worlds above worlds...

776
01:05:47,932 --> 01:05:50,702
going farther up than you can imagine.

777
01:05:50,702 --> 01:05:54,102
And the trash of each one flows down to the one below...

778
01:05:54,102 --> 01:05:56,742
'til it all ends up here.

779
01:05:57,882 --> 01:06:00,112
It's where I used to live.

780
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:02,412
And it's where you're going to die.

781
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:34,452
Dance, little flea.

782
01:07:17,122 --> 01:07:19,392
I was forgotten here to rot.

783
01:07:19,962 --> 01:07:21,362
But I was saved...

784
01:07:21,762 --> 01:07:22,892
remade...

785
01:07:22,892 --> 01:07:26,332
by the same hand that shapes your destiny even now.

786
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,132
Whose hand?

787
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:32,202
My master, Nova.

788
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:33,842
What do you know about me?

789
01:08:04,242 --> 01:08:07,142
You have the soul of a survivor.

790
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:11,542
You'll never give up.

791
01:08:14,982 --> 01:08:16,042
Aah.

792
01:08:16,052 --> 01:08:17,552
Know what is hidden.

793
01:08:18,582 --> 01:08:20,222
Always ask...

794
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:23,292
what is it that you are not seeing?

795
01:08:24,222 --> 01:08:26,192
Nova?

796
01:08:26,192 --> 01:08:29,362
He is the dragon that must be slain.

797
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:32,332
Again.

798
01:08:33,202 --> 01:08:35,702
Look at you.

799
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:37,572
Where are you going?

800
01:08:46,382 --> 01:08:48,252
What's the matter?

801
01:08:48,252 --> 01:08:50,182
My little toy doesn't want to play anymore?

802
01:08:51,552 --> 01:08:53,852
I'll turn you into a living pendant

803
01:08:53,852 --> 01:08:55,882
to adorn my chest.

804
01:08:55,892 --> 01:08:59,292
Then I can hear your voice every moment of the day...

805
01:08:59,292 --> 01:09:01,562
pleading for mercy!

806
01:09:14,912 --> 01:09:16,512
Hi-yah!

807
01:09:21,752 --> 01:09:23,282
Fuck your mercy.

808
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:33,492
No!

809
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:00,322
Break off!

810
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:07,862
He wasn't a dog lover.I hate that.

811
01:10:10,332 --> 01:10:12,032
Oh, come on.

812
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:18,772
I'm sorry.

813
01:10:19,902 --> 01:10:21,472
I'm so sorry.

814
01:10:30,682 --> 01:10:33,922
You think you can replace us that easily?

815
01:10:33,922 --> 01:10:36,722
Bring her back as many times as you like.

816
01:11:12,562 --> 01:11:14,892
No one will dare harm you again.

817
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:33,652
It's the adaptive technology of the Berserker body.

818
01:11:36,012 --> 01:11:37,612
The shell is reconfiguring

819
01:11:37,622 --> 01:11:40,022
to her subconscious imageof herself.

820
01:11:42,452 --> 01:11:45,052
I've never seen anything like it.

821
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:48,992
It's making micro-adjustments throughout every system.

822
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:56,032
Looks like she's a little older than you thought.

823
01:12:17,022 --> 01:12:18,992
Well, look at you.

824
01:12:41,082 --> 01:12:43,352
Well, you were right.

825
01:12:43,352 --> 01:12:45,852
A warrior's spirit needs a warrior's body.

826
01:12:56,632 --> 01:12:59,962
It draws in air,generating an arc plasma...

827
01:12:59,972 --> 01:13:02,402
but how you control it,I don't know.

828
01:13:02,402 --> 01:13:05,302
Didn't exactly come with a manual, did you?

829
01:13:05,302 --> 01:13:06,942
It's some kind of weapon.

830
01:13:15,152 --> 01:13:16,912
Now you know who you are.

831
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:28,192
But that's just a shell.

832
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:31,832
It's not bad or good.

833
01:13:33,062 --> 01:13:34,672
That part's up to you.

834
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:47,682
Check these out.

835
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,022
Pretty fresh, right?

836
01:13:56,222 --> 01:13:57,222
Alita!

837
01:14:00,962 --> 01:14:01,962
Wow.

838
01:14:03,132 --> 01:14:04,832
You're...

839
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:07,232
- Back together?- Very back together.

840
01:14:10,302 --> 01:14:11,772
You look...

841
01:14:12,342 --> 01:14:13,472
different.

842
01:14:13,472 --> 01:14:14,872
It's all Nano-tech.

843
01:14:14,872 --> 01:14:16,972
It's a bunch of stuff even Ido hasn't figured out yet.

844
01:14:16,982 --> 01:14:19,182
So are you stronger than you were?

845
01:14:19,182 --> 01:14:20,912
Yeah. And faster, too.

846
01:14:21,982 --> 01:14:23,182
It feels...

847
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:25,552
more me.

848
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:30,722
You know,some guys might be

849
01:14:30,722 --> 01:14:32,162
intimidated by a girl like you.

850
01:14:32,162 --> 01:14:33,322
Really? Why is that?

851
01:14:33,322 --> 01:14:34,822
'Cause you could rip my arm off

852
01:14:34,832 --> 01:14:36,162
and beat me with the wet end.

853
01:14:37,762 --> 01:14:40,632
Well, then,don't piss me off.

854
01:14:41,672 --> 01:14:44,132
Why don't you like her?

855
01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:47,242
I just never got the whole hardbody thing.

856
01:14:47,242 --> 01:14:48,802
And besides, she's URM.

857
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,372
It means she was probably the enemy at one point.

858
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:55,082
Yeah, 300 years ago.

859
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:56,252
Get over it.

860
01:14:59,122 --> 01:15:01,882
I'm a lot more touch sensitive, too.

861
01:15:01,892 --> 01:15:04,362
A lot higher density of force feedback and...

862
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:07,192
texture sensors.

863
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:10,962
You wanna try it?

864
01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:20,072
You can feel this?

865
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:21,772
Yes.

866
01:15:26,742 --> 01:15:28,052
Close your eyes.

867
01:15:28,782 --> 01:15:30,682
Close your eyes.

868
01:15:37,322 --> 01:15:38,992
How about this?

869
01:15:39,462 --> 01:15:40,762
Yes.

870
01:15:45,562 --> 01:15:47,002
Where am I now?

871
01:15:48,532 --> 01:15:49,942
You're...

872
01:15:52,272 --> 01:15:53,312
with me.

873
01:16:12,292 --> 01:16:14,292
Does it bother you...

874
01:16:15,532 --> 01:16:18,392
that I'm not completely human?

875
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:22,272
You are the most human person I have ever met.

876
01:16:38,082 --> 01:16:40,422
He won't even let me fix his eye.

877
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:41,892
He says he wants the pain.

878
01:16:48,262 --> 01:16:49,262
Enough.

879
01:16:55,272 --> 01:16:56,472
Nova.

880
01:17:01,812 --> 01:17:03,382
You have failed me.

881
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:07,412
Stand.

882
01:17:11,152 --> 01:17:15,422
You will never triumph until you understand what she is.

883
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,222
She's the last of her kind.

884
01:17:17,222 --> 01:17:19,932
The finest weapon of the URM Technarchy.

885
01:17:21,062 --> 01:17:24,032
I need you to destroy this Alita.

886
01:17:24,032 --> 01:17:26,102
I need you to bring me her heart.

887
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:30,502
I live only for her death.

888
01:17:39,212 --> 01:17:40,982
I hate when he does that.

889
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:47,222
This is not a man who tolerates failure.

890
01:17:48,892 --> 01:17:52,352
I'm not trusting my future to a piece of iron.

891
01:17:52,362 --> 01:17:54,262
What do you have in mind?

892
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:05,072
To dreams.

893
01:18:08,612 --> 01:18:10,672
I like your drive, Hugo.

894
01:18:10,682 --> 01:18:13,082
You have a solid future with my team.

895
01:18:14,582 --> 01:18:16,382
My future's in Zalem.

896
01:18:17,152 --> 01:18:19,082
I remember your promise every day.

897
01:18:20,322 --> 01:18:21,392
To send me up.

898
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:24,192
When I get you a million credits.

899
01:18:24,822 --> 01:18:26,262
Personally...

900
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:30,492
I'd rather rule in hell than serve in heaven.

901
01:18:33,362 --> 01:18:35,672
We'd be at the bottom of the food chain up there

902
01:18:35,672 --> 01:18:37,142
but down here...

903
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:40,372
we can live like kings.

904
01:18:43,242 --> 01:18:44,872
So...

905
01:18:44,872 --> 01:18:47,212
Tell me about this friend of yours.

906
01:18:48,312 --> 01:18:49,642
Alita?

907
01:18:49,652 --> 01:18:51,152
Is that her name?

908
01:18:51,152 --> 01:18:53,122
Alita. Hmm.

909
01:19:08,502 --> 01:19:09,502
Hi.

910
01:19:10,672 --> 01:19:11,902
Hi.

911
01:19:17,012 --> 01:19:19,012
What happened to you?

912
01:19:19,012 --> 01:19:21,382
I wound up hanging out with Vector.

913
01:19:22,612 --> 01:19:24,382
Some alcohol was involved.

914
01:19:25,652 --> 01:19:26,922
Apparently.

915
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:29,292
So, Vector?

916
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:31,562
Is that your connection for getting into Zalem?

917
01:19:32,692 --> 01:19:33,892
Yeah.

918
01:19:34,262 --> 01:19:35,262
Oh.

919
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:38,302
I was hoping may be you'd wanna stay.

920
01:19:39,102 --> 01:19:42,202
Hey, it's not right away.

921
01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:45,472
I still gotta raise the rest of the money first.

922
01:19:45,472 --> 01:19:46,542
It's okay.

923
01:19:47,972 --> 01:19:49,842
It's your dream.

924
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:52,412
I know it's what you've always wanted.

925
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,582
You know...

926
01:19:58,652 --> 01:20:00,082
I was always so sure.

927
01:20:03,022 --> 01:20:04,462
Now you come along...

928
01:20:06,522 --> 01:20:08,162
nothing's clear anymore.

929
01:20:24,142 --> 01:20:26,342
How much more do you need before you can go?

930
01:20:28,652 --> 01:20:30,082
90k.

931
01:20:30,582 --> 01:20:31,622
90k?

932
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,152
I can make that in bounties.

933
01:20:34,152 --> 01:20:35,252
I'll just figure out who has

934
01:20:35,252 --> 01:20:36,522
the highest prices on their heads...

935
01:20:36,522 --> 01:20:37,492
and then I'll take them out.

936
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:39,462
No, I can't ask you to do that for me.

937
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:42,162
I'd do whatever I had to for you.

938
01:20:43,232 --> 01:20:44,992
I'd give you whatever I have.

939
01:20:45,002 --> 01:20:46,262
What are you doing?

940
01:20:49,032 --> 01:20:50,942
I'd give you my heart.

941
01:20:52,202 --> 01:20:54,042
Take it.

942
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:56,212
It's got an URM Micro-Reactor for a power supply

943
01:20:56,212 --> 01:20:57,942
probably worth millions.

944
01:20:57,942 --> 01:20:59,642
With your connections,you can find a buyer...

945
01:20:59,642 --> 01:21:02,012
you could make enough for both of us to go to Zalem...

946
01:21:02,012 --> 01:21:03,512
and then we just find a cheap replacement...

947
01:21:03,512 --> 01:21:04,582
No.

948
01:21:05,852 --> 01:21:08,722
Come on, you buy and sell parts all day long.

949
01:21:11,262 --> 01:21:13,162
Don't just do things for people.

950
01:21:14,562 --> 01:21:16,262
No matter how good you think they are

951
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:18,162
or how deserving they are.

952
01:21:19,132 --> 01:21:21,032
It's all or nothing with me.

953
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:24,502
This is who I am.

954
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:27,002
I know.

955
01:21:29,712 --> 01:21:30,712
It's okay.

956
01:21:31,812 --> 01:21:33,282
Put it back.

957
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:47,732
That was pretty intense, huh?

958
01:21:50,902 --> 01:21:52,732
Yeah, that was very intense.

959
01:21:54,632 --> 01:21:56,032
Sorry.

960
01:21:57,702 --> 01:22:00,042
Maybe there's another way.

961
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:02,972
Vector wants you to try out for Second League.

962
01:22:02,972 --> 01:22:04,312
What?

963
01:22:04,312 --> 01:22:06,542
You become a big Motorball star

964
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:08,242
make a pile of money...

965
01:22:08,252 --> 01:22:10,212
we can go to Zalem together.

966
01:22:10,212 --> 01:22:11,512
What are you talking about?

967
01:22:11,522 --> 01:22:13,792
I can't be a pro-Motorball player.

968
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:15,792
Ali...

969
01:22:16,952 --> 01:22:18,362
you could be a champion.

970
01:22:19,592 --> 01:22:20,762
You win this tryout...

971
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:23,362
every scout will be killing each other to get to you.

972
01:22:25,502 --> 01:22:26,532
We'll be home free.

973
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:29,032
Only if you'll be my coach.

974
01:22:30,072 --> 01:22:31,132
Well, if that's what it takes.

975
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:33,242
That's what it takes.

976
01:22:40,282 --> 01:22:42,442
Are you going to kill her?

977
01:22:42,452 --> 01:22:43,452
No.

978
01:22:43,912 --> 01:22:45,482
Much worse.

979
01:22:59,502 --> 01:23:01,232
Ido, can a human love a cyborg?

980
01:23:03,032 --> 01:23:04,302
Why?

981
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:06,502
Does this cyborg love a human?

982
01:23:10,872 --> 01:23:12,282
Mm-hmm.

983
01:23:13,242 --> 01:23:16,212
A human can love a cyborg...

984
01:23:16,212 --> 01:23:17,852
but you have to keep your mind on the game, Alita.

985
01:23:19,352 --> 01:23:21,522
It can get very rough out there.

986
01:23:21,522 --> 01:23:23,452
Even for a tryout.

987
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:25,692
Try these.

988
01:23:27,822 --> 01:23:29,562
Did you make these for me?

989
01:23:30,462 --> 01:23:31,632
Yes.

990
01:23:33,132 --> 01:23:36,272
They won't make you any faster. It's regulation.

991
01:23:37,402 --> 01:23:39,402
But at least they won't fail you.

992
01:23:43,842 --> 01:23:45,342
Here's our deal.

993
01:23:46,682 --> 01:23:48,882
You go in there, you race

994
01:23:48,882 --> 01:23:50,652
you win,you come back right here.

995
01:23:50,652 --> 01:23:55,752
You wear all of these pads,especially this one.

996
01:23:57,222 --> 01:23:58,952
I don't need all this crap.

997
01:23:58,962 --> 01:24:00,462
Yes, you do.

998
01:24:01,592 --> 01:24:02,992
Remember...

999
01:24:02,992 --> 01:24:05,332
if you wreck this body,I can't fix it.

1000
01:24:05,332 --> 01:24:08,232
- This is URM technology.- Yes, I know.

1001
01:24:08,232 --> 01:24:09,562
Now, go find a place to watch

1002
01:24:09,572 --> 01:24:10,902
because you're making me nervous.

1003
01:24:14,002 --> 01:24:15,612
Good luck.

1004
01:24:16,412 --> 01:24:17,612
Bye.

1005
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,992
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

1006
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:41,062
You are the scum of the game.

1007
01:24:41,072 --> 01:24:44,372
But tonight,you are hand-picked scum.

1008
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,542
Because tonight is not a game.

1009
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:48,402
It is a hunt.

1010
01:24:48,412 --> 01:24:50,742
I'm paying 500,000...

1011
01:24:50,742 --> 01:24:56,352
to the one who kills the girl called Alita.

1012
01:25:02,092 --> 01:25:03,182
Hey.

1013
01:25:03,192 --> 01:25:05,222
Where are you? The tryout's about to start.

1014
01:25:05,222 --> 01:25:06,692
I'm on my way.

1015
01:25:06,692 --> 01:25:08,932
There's something I've gotta do first.

1016
01:25:08,932 --> 01:25:10,292
I'm doing this for us,remember?

1017
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:11,632
You can't miss it.

1018
01:25:11,632 --> 01:25:13,432
I won't. Trust me.

1019
01:25:17,372 --> 01:25:20,102
Please, just stop.

1020
01:25:20,102 --> 01:25:21,402
I didn't do anything to you.

1021
01:25:21,402 --> 01:25:24,272
It's just business.Nothing personal.

1022
01:25:26,842 --> 01:25:27,882
Tanji, stop!

1023
01:25:30,312 --> 01:25:31,582
Using my name?

1024
01:25:33,122 --> 01:25:34,692
Man, what's wrong with you?

1025
01:25:36,252 --> 01:25:38,592
I can't do this anymore.

1026
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:40,792
What's the matter? You're already gone half the time.

1027
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:43,132
Now you show up with this line of crap!

1028
01:25:43,132 --> 01:25:45,332
It's the little hard body,isn't it?

1029
01:25:45,332 --> 01:25:48,532
Listen, it's over.Do you understand?

1030
01:25:48,532 --> 01:25:49,732
I'm out.

1031
01:25:49,732 --> 01:25:52,772
And if you had any brains,you'd leave this behind, too.

1032
01:25:54,242 --> 01:25:55,742
I'm out.

1033
01:25:56,772 --> 01:25:57,942
For good.

1034
01:25:59,582 --> 01:26:02,342
You should've jacked that bitch when you had the chance.

1035
01:26:02,352 --> 01:26:04,452
Would've been on your way to Zalem right now.

1036
01:26:20,062 --> 01:26:21,502
Well, very professional.

1037
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,002
Hey, man,we don't want any trouble.

1038
01:26:23,002 --> 01:26:26,302
If this is your mark,we're sorry. He's all yours.

1039
01:26:28,572 --> 01:26:29,772
Hugo.

1040
01:26:30,712 --> 01:26:32,512
Jacking cyborgs.

1041
01:26:32,512 --> 01:26:33,742
Your little girlfriend might take that

1042
01:26:33,742 --> 01:26:35,952
kind of personally,don't you think?

1043
01:26:36,212 --> 01:26:37,782
Hmm?

1044
01:26:37,782 --> 01:26:39,882
But you know girls.

1045
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:42,552
She'll probably get all weepy and forgive you...

1046
01:26:44,052 --> 01:26:45,892
when I show her your head.

1047
01:26:45,892 --> 01:26:47,432
There's no marker out on me.

1048
01:26:54,162 --> 01:26:56,232
There will be.

1049
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:58,402
Murder pulls a tight little bounty...

1050
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,872
even with gutter trash like you.

1051
01:27:01,872 --> 01:27:03,782
I never killed anyone.

1052
01:27:09,412 --> 01:27:11,052
You just did.

1053
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:20,052
She thinks she can punk me, huh?

1054
01:27:24,332 --> 01:27:25,732
Hugo, run!

1055
01:28:31,362 --> 01:28:34,362
Next up is Second League tryouts.

1056
01:28:34,362 --> 01:28:37,572
Will the Factory practice team report to the line?

1057
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:47,542
The winner tonight will make it one step closer...

1058
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:50,612
to qualifying for the Champions League.

1059
01:28:50,612 --> 01:28:53,522
Well, that is one tough lineup.

1060
01:28:53,522 --> 01:28:55,752
This is gonna be one heck of a match tonight.

1061
01:29:04,162 --> 01:29:05,802
That's no Factory team.

1062
01:29:06,802 --> 01:29:08,332
What?

1063
01:29:08,332 --> 01:29:10,532
These two punks in the back...

1064
01:29:10,532 --> 01:29:12,672
there are bounty markers on them.

1065
01:29:14,502 --> 01:29:17,912
And the other guys,they are Hunter-Warriors.

1066
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:30,792
And here comes tonight's one new prospect.

1067
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:35,562
Okay, then, folks,give it up for Alita!

1068
01:29:37,162 --> 01:29:39,332
Hugo brought her right to us.

1069
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,832
- What'd you promise him?- Hmm.

1070
01:29:43,402 --> 01:29:45,842
I'm sending him to Zalem,of course.

1071
01:29:55,912 --> 01:29:58,152
Alita! Alita!

1072
01:30:02,392 --> 01:30:03,682
Hey.

1073
01:30:03,692 --> 01:30:05,022
Since there is only one new prospect...

1074
01:30:05,022 --> 01:30:07,592
- What's up?- ...there will be no teams.

1075
01:30:07,592 --> 01:30:11,032
The name of the gameis Cut-throat.

1076
01:30:15,732 --> 01:30:17,772
Go easy on me, guys.

1077
01:30:18,442 --> 01:30:20,232
Sure, kid.

1078
01:30:20,242 --> 01:30:21,842
No worries.

1079
01:30:24,982 --> 01:30:27,512
- Alita!- What are you doing?

1080
01:30:27,512 --> 01:30:29,512
It's a setup.You gotta get outta there.

1081
01:30:29,512 --> 01:30:31,252
They're gonna kill you!

1082
01:30:34,892 --> 01:30:36,222
Which ones?

1083
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,622
All of them!

1084
01:30:40,692 --> 01:30:43,762
Players, 10-second warning.

1085
01:30:50,072 --> 01:30:51,302
Five seconds...

1086
01:31:10,122 --> 01:31:11,452
The new kid, Alita,

1087
01:31:11,452 --> 01:31:14,062
takes possession right off the snap.

1088
01:31:22,832 --> 01:31:27,272
A slow Tuesday night just got hotter than the playoffs.

1089
01:31:37,682 --> 01:31:40,122
Looks like the fans have themselves

1090
01:31:40,122 --> 01:31:41,352
an underdog darling...

1091
01:31:41,352 --> 01:31:45,722
with the face of an angel and a body built for battle.

1092
01:31:53,332 --> 01:31:54,702
Maybe a little Motorball

1093
01:31:54,702 --> 01:31:56,472
will break out in the middle of this fight.

1094
01:31:56,472 --> 01:31:58,302
Oh, crap.

1095
01:32:09,412 --> 01:32:10,552
Oh! Looks like it's

1096
01:32:10,552 --> 01:32:12,652
"No rules Tuesday" out there, folks.

1097
01:32:24,732 --> 01:32:27,202
Ouch!You know that hurts!

1098
01:32:31,302 --> 01:32:35,072
Stinger's got Alitain a lot of trouble.

1099
01:32:46,782 --> 01:32:49,422
She must've said somethingin the locker room

1100
01:32:49,422 --> 01:32:51,662
that these guys did not like.

1101
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:13,512
Number 99...

1102
01:33:13,512 --> 01:33:15,252
Alita!

1103
01:33:20,552 --> 01:33:22,222
Ali, it's me.

1104
01:33:22,922 --> 01:33:24,382
I've got a big problem.

1105
01:33:24,392 --> 01:33:27,052
Hugo, this is not a good time.

1106
01:33:27,062 --> 01:33:28,692
He's trying to kill me.

1107
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,632
Who's trying to kill you?

1108
01:33:30,632 --> 01:33:32,832
Zapan, the Hunter-Warrior.

1109
01:33:33,532 --> 01:33:35,102
He killed Tanji.

1110
01:33:35,662 --> 01:33:37,132
What do you mean?

1111
01:33:37,132 --> 01:33:39,242
Now, he's coming for me.

1112
01:33:43,612 --> 01:33:45,372
Not sure our Battle Angel

1113
01:33:45,382 --> 01:33:46,942
can get out of this one.

1114
01:33:48,242 --> 01:33:50,282
Oh, shit. Here he comes!

1115
01:33:52,182 --> 01:33:53,082
Where are you?

1116
01:33:53,082 --> 01:33:54,992
I'm headed to the old church.

1117
01:33:56,122 --> 01:33:58,022
Okay. I'm coming.

1118
01:34:05,762 --> 01:34:08,162
I can't believe it!Incredible!

1119
01:34:08,162 --> 01:34:10,872
I've never seen anything like this.

1120
01:35:11,562 --> 01:35:13,802
Hey, I'm almost there.

1121
01:35:13,802 --> 01:35:15,072
Got it.

1122
01:36:17,592 --> 01:36:18,962
Where are you going, huh?

1123
01:36:48,362 --> 01:36:51,232
Looks like your Hugo hasn't been entirely honest with you.

1124
01:36:53,632 --> 01:36:55,332
Is it true?

1125
01:36:55,632 --> 01:36:56,672
Ali...

1126
01:36:57,972 --> 01:36:59,372
you don't understand.

1127
01:37:04,572 --> 01:37:06,382
I never killed anyone.

1128
01:37:07,482 --> 01:37:09,482
We only jacked parts.

1129
01:37:10,952 --> 01:37:13,652
We paralyzed them and stripped them, that's all.

1130
01:37:16,222 --> 01:37:18,292
I needed the money for Zalem.

1131
01:37:20,222 --> 01:37:22,492
Step aside and let me do my job.

1132
01:37:25,832 --> 01:37:28,362
Touch him again and I will kill you.

1133
01:37:28,362 --> 01:37:29,332
Interference between

1134
01:37:29,332 --> 01:37:31,372
a licensed Hunter-Warriorand his kill...

1135
01:37:31,372 --> 01:37:34,602
is a violation of Factory Law and the Hunter's Code.

1136
01:37:34,612 --> 01:37:36,472
He's mine!

1137
01:37:38,012 --> 01:37:40,112
Then make the kill.

1138
01:37:47,582 --> 01:37:49,552
Come on, Hunter-Warrior.

1139
01:37:51,092 --> 01:37:53,292
Tonight, you becomeone of us.

1140
01:37:59,762 --> 01:38:01,162
Mm-mmm.

1141
01:38:01,162 --> 01:38:03,202
You know, there's no room for love or mercy

1142
01:38:03,202 --> 01:38:04,602
in the Hunter's Code.

1143
01:38:13,212 --> 01:38:15,712
Let me make it easier for you.

1144
01:38:23,352 --> 01:38:24,392
Hugo!

1145
01:38:29,132 --> 01:38:33,162
Deliver the criminal Hugo, Bounty 9107.

1146
01:38:33,162 --> 01:38:36,232
Wanted for the crime of murder.

1147
01:38:36,232 --> 01:38:38,902
You better finish him before we do!

1148
01:38:38,902 --> 01:38:41,272
It's Hunter Law!

1149
01:38:48,612 --> 01:38:50,042
I have to get you to Ido.

1150
01:38:50,052 --> 01:38:52,482
No. Centurions.

1151
01:38:52,482 --> 01:38:54,852
If you go back out there with me alive

1152
01:38:54,852 --> 01:38:56,552
they'll kill us both.

1153
01:39:00,092 --> 01:39:03,262
What did you do? What did you do?

1154
01:39:05,692 --> 01:39:07,432
I didn't kill that guy.

1155
01:39:09,632 --> 01:39:11,202
But what does it matter?

1156
01:39:13,542 --> 01:39:15,142
I tore people apart.

1157
01:39:15,912 --> 01:39:19,142
People like you, for money.

1158
01:39:21,642 --> 01:39:23,942
Where were you tonight?

1159
01:39:23,952 --> 01:39:26,212
I went to go stop the others.

1160
01:39:26,222 --> 01:39:28,622
- And tell them I quit.- Why?

1161
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:31,892
Because I love you.

1162
01:39:36,032 --> 01:39:37,732
God, I'm sorry.

1163
01:39:53,142 --> 01:39:54,382
Did you find them?

1164
01:39:55,742 --> 01:39:57,082
No.

1165
01:39:57,782 --> 01:39:59,422
They're gone.

1166
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:07,162
You're so cold.Please don't die.

1167
01:40:08,462 --> 01:40:10,092
Please don't.

1168
01:40:18,532 --> 01:40:21,442
I'd give him my life if I could.

1169
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:36,622
Maybe you can.

1170
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,992
You have violated Factory Law and the Hunter's Code

1171
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:46,562
by protecting a wanted felon.

1172
01:40:48,332 --> 01:40:52,802
Where is the criminal Hugo, Bounty 9107?

1173
01:40:58,072 --> 01:40:59,312
Hugo is dead.

1174
01:40:59,812 --> 01:41:01,342
I claim the bounty.

1175
01:41:01,342 --> 01:41:03,882
Hunter-Warrior 26651.

1176
01:41:05,322 --> 01:41:07,522
Claim confirmed.

1177
01:41:14,092 --> 01:41:15,292
Ah.

1178
01:41:18,192 --> 01:41:20,132
Yeah, that's a cute trick.

1179
01:41:20,132 --> 01:41:22,572
You think this is gonna work, huh? Hmm?

1180
01:41:23,832 --> 01:41:26,172
Give me that.

1181
01:41:26,172 --> 01:41:27,872
Violation.

1182
01:41:27,872 --> 01:41:29,942
Hunter-Warrior Zapan...

1183
01:41:29,942 --> 01:41:31,672
stealing another's bounty

1184
01:41:31,682 --> 01:41:34,612
is against Factory Law and the Hunter's Code.

1185
01:41:34,612 --> 01:41:35,782
Thanks.

1186
01:41:39,722 --> 01:41:40,882
My face.

1187
01:41:41,892 --> 01:41:43,422
My... My face!

1188
01:41:44,692 --> 01:41:46,122
My face!

1189
01:41:46,122 --> 01:41:47,592
No!

1190
01:42:02,572 --> 01:42:03,612
How is he?

1191
01:42:11,152 --> 01:42:14,522
This city corrupts even good people.

1192
01:42:20,262 --> 01:42:21,692
He's good.

1193
01:42:22,092 --> 01:42:23,292
He's stable.

1194
01:42:30,732 --> 01:42:33,602
Chiren's surgical technique was brilliant.

1195
01:42:35,942 --> 01:42:37,982
There's no brain damage.

1196
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:47,622
Vector was running a scam.

1197
01:42:47,622 --> 01:42:49,822
If you're born on the ground,you stay on the ground...

1198
01:42:49,822 --> 01:42:51,892
and no amount of money can change that.

1199
01:42:51,892 --> 01:42:54,992
The only one way to get from the lower world to Zalem...

1200
01:42:54,992 --> 01:42:57,022
is to become Final Champion.

1201
01:42:57,032 --> 01:42:59,692
You can't buy your way up there.

1202
01:42:59,702 --> 01:43:01,802
But how do you know that for sure?

1203
01:43:05,832 --> 01:43:06,972
I was born there.

1204
01:43:09,572 --> 01:43:13,282
I've removed it myself,the Mark of Zalem.

1205
01:43:15,242 --> 01:43:16,712
With our daughter's illness

1206
01:43:16,712 --> 01:43:20,412
Chiren and I were forced to descend here to Iron City.

1207
01:43:20,422 --> 01:43:23,452
And the man responsible for our exile...

1208
01:43:23,452 --> 01:43:25,952
the watcher behind the eyes...

1209
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,962
is Nova.

1210
01:43:29,462 --> 01:43:31,762
You had her heart in your hands...

1211
01:43:33,502 --> 01:43:35,772
and you let her live.

1212
01:43:37,202 --> 01:43:38,972
- I did.- Why?

1213
01:43:41,142 --> 01:43:42,972
Because I'm a doctor.

1214
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,882
And...

1215
01:43:46,912 --> 01:43:48,742
I'm a mother.

1216
01:43:50,212 --> 01:43:52,582
And somehow I forgot that.

1217
01:43:55,322 --> 01:43:57,522
I can't do this anymore.

1218
01:43:59,722 --> 01:44:00,892
I'm out.

1219
01:44:04,032 --> 01:44:05,562
Chiren, wait.

1220
01:44:16,772 --> 01:44:18,682
Don't you think it's time you went to Zalem?

1221
01:44:21,412 --> 01:44:24,342
I could send you up there right now.

1222
01:44:24,352 --> 01:44:26,652
What I want...

1223
01:44:28,182 --> 01:44:30,392
it isn't up there.

1224
01:44:48,842 --> 01:44:51,672
I have to do something.

1225
01:44:51,672 --> 01:44:53,882
I'll come back for you.

1226
01:44:56,382 --> 01:44:58,412
This is my fault.

1227
01:45:01,322 --> 01:45:02,922
This is my fault.

1228
01:45:02,922 --> 01:45:05,562
Don't ever feel sorry for yourself.

1229
01:45:06,792 --> 01:45:09,132
You're the only one built for this.

1230
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:12,962
Thank you, Father.

1231
01:45:31,682 --> 01:45:33,122
Vector!

1232
01:45:34,682 --> 01:45:36,682
Hostile intention detected.

1233
01:45:36,692 --> 01:45:38,622
Surrender your weapon.

1234
01:45:47,232 --> 01:45:49,072
Surrender your weapon.

1235
01:46:08,152 --> 01:46:09,692
Security report.

1236
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:14,522
Violation! Violation!

1237
01:46:15,092 --> 01:46:16,632
Violation! Violation!

1238
01:46:21,032 --> 01:46:22,572
Did you get her?

1239
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,232
Security?

1240
01:46:31,842 --> 01:46:35,852
You were never going to send Hugo to Zalem, were you?

1241
01:46:38,212 --> 01:46:40,082
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1242
01:46:40,082 --> 01:46:42,622
I always keep my promise to send people up.

1243
01:46:46,362 --> 01:46:48,492
Like Dr. Chiren here.

1244
01:46:50,592 --> 01:46:54,162
Nova demands body parts for his experiments.

1245
01:46:54,162 --> 01:46:57,072
Especially, the brains of people he admires.

1246
01:47:00,972 --> 01:47:05,172
And that is the only way anyone ever gets to Zalem.

1247
01:47:11,152 --> 01:47:12,622
It took you long enough.

1248
01:47:16,052 --> 01:47:18,152
I knew you wouldn't wait for your fate

1249
01:47:18,152 --> 01:47:19,752
to find you, little flea.

1250
01:47:19,762 --> 01:47:22,122
Get up.

1251
01:47:33,342 --> 01:47:34,912
Defense Ring!

1252
01:48:02,702 --> 01:48:04,102
Finish the mission.

1253
01:48:04,602 --> 01:48:07,142
Destroy Zalem.

1254
01:48:12,372 --> 01:48:15,582
Destroy Zalem.

1255
01:48:28,862 --> 01:48:30,832
I know who my enemy is.

1256
01:48:32,062 --> 01:48:34,102
And I know he's watching us now.

1257
01:48:36,472 --> 01:48:38,002
And you're just his slave.

1258
01:48:46,942 --> 01:48:49,882
And I'm just an insignificant girl.

1259
01:49:16,502 --> 01:49:17,642
Speak.

1260
01:49:17,642 --> 01:49:20,072
No. No. No. Wait.

1261
01:49:20,082 --> 01:49:21,142
Speak!

1262
01:49:21,142 --> 01:49:23,012
What do you want me to say? I will say anything.

1263
01:49:23,012 --> 01:49:24,582
Not you.

1264
01:49:24,582 --> 01:49:25,782
Him!

1265
01:49:35,092 --> 01:49:36,962
So we finally meet, Alita.

1266
01:49:37,862 --> 01:49:40,032
Not your real name, of course.

1267
01:49:40,032 --> 01:49:41,102
Nova?

1268
01:49:54,482 --> 01:49:55,682
Where are you?

1269
01:49:56,152 --> 01:49:59,082
Home. As we speak.

1270
01:49:59,082 --> 01:50:00,822
Feet up.

1271
01:50:01,822 --> 01:50:02,982
Well, my girl

1272
01:50:02,992 --> 01:50:05,952
you've certainly exceeded my expectations.

1273
01:50:05,952 --> 01:50:08,762
Killing my champion Grewishka.

1274
01:50:08,762 --> 01:50:10,092
Most impressive.

1275
01:50:10,992 --> 01:50:14,762
And turning a selfish creature like Chiren.

1276
01:50:14,762 --> 01:50:17,062
I didn't see that coming.

1277
01:50:17,072 --> 01:50:21,172
So, when you walk out of here,the Factory won't stop you.

1278
01:50:22,602 --> 01:50:24,042
This time.

1279
01:50:24,042 --> 01:50:26,842
I don't need your permission to live.

1280
01:50:26,842 --> 01:50:28,442
Others might.

1281
01:50:29,382 --> 01:50:31,152
Your Dr. Ido, for example.

1282
01:50:32,152 --> 01:50:33,782
And what about Hugo?

1283
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:36,292
He's still alive, isn't he?

1284
01:50:36,922 --> 01:50:38,722
We will track him down.

1285
01:50:38,722 --> 01:50:39,922
Hmm.

1286
01:50:39,922 --> 01:50:42,792
I've found the only way to enjoy immortality...

1287
01:50:43,562 --> 01:50:45,432
is to watch others die.

1288
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:49,162
You just lost a puppet.

1289
01:50:52,702 --> 01:50:55,472
Well, that looks fatal.

1290
01:50:56,442 --> 01:50:57,512
No matter.

1291
01:50:58,542 --> 01:51:00,512
Vector was getting tire-some.

1292
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:06,922
You've made the biggest mistake of your life.

1293
01:51:07,752 --> 01:51:09,282
And what's that?

1294
01:51:10,392 --> 01:51:12,252
Underestimating who I am.

1295
01:51:13,692 --> 01:51:15,862
Then until next time.

1296
01:51:17,292 --> 01:51:18,292
Remember.

1297
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:24,802
I see everything.

1298
01:51:29,812 --> 01:51:31,602
Alita.

1299
01:51:31,612 --> 01:51:33,672
Factory enforcers came looking for Hugo.

1300
01:51:33,682 --> 01:51:35,842
Somehow they knew he'd been kept alive.

1301
01:51:35,852 --> 01:51:38,582
I helped him escape,but they've sealed the city.

1302
01:51:38,582 --> 01:51:40,822
- They're going to find him.- Where is he?

1303
01:51:41,482 --> 01:51:42,892
He's trying to go up.

1304
01:52:03,672 --> 01:52:04,942
Hugo!

1305
01:52:05,642 --> 01:52:06,912
Hugo!

1306
01:52:07,682 --> 01:52:08,882
Hugo.

1307
01:52:09,582 --> 01:52:11,112
Hugo!

1308
01:52:11,112 --> 01:52:12,112
Stop.

1309
01:52:12,112 --> 01:52:14,082
You have to come down.We can't stay up here.

1310
01:52:14,082 --> 01:52:17,022
There's a bounty on me.This is the only way.

1311
01:52:17,022 --> 01:52:19,722
No, this is dangerous.We have to get down, now.

1312
01:52:19,722 --> 01:52:21,352
If I go back down there,I'm dead.

1313
01:52:21,362 --> 01:52:23,562
No. You have to listen to me, okay?

1314
01:52:23,562 --> 01:52:25,162
I've been right here before.

1315
01:52:25,162 --> 01:52:27,632
This is exactly where Nova wants you.

1316
01:52:27,632 --> 01:52:29,832
He's using you to get to me.

1317
01:52:29,832 --> 01:52:31,532
Come on,we have to go back down.

1318
01:52:31,532 --> 01:52:33,342
We belong up there, Alita.

1319
01:52:34,772 --> 01:52:38,072
We don't belong anywhere except together.

1320
01:52:42,442 --> 01:52:44,052
You'll always be running.

1321
01:52:46,182 --> 01:52:47,282
Together.

1322
01:52:48,752 --> 01:52:50,152
Come with me.

1323
01:52:51,652 --> 01:52:53,022
Please.

1324
01:52:55,822 --> 01:52:57,532
We could be free.

1325
01:53:08,402 --> 01:53:09,772
Okay.

1326
01:53:13,812 --> 01:53:15,012
No!

1327
01:53:21,752 --> 01:53:23,352
No!

1328
01:53:37,202 --> 01:53:38,332
Hold on.

1329
01:53:39,202 --> 01:53:40,372
I got you.

1330
01:53:43,942 --> 01:53:46,242
Okay, okay. Don't move.

1331
01:53:47,882 --> 01:53:49,842
Don't move.

1332
01:53:49,852 --> 01:53:51,982
I'm gonna lift you up slowly.

1333
01:54:09,302 --> 01:54:10,672
Thank you...

1334
01:54:11,972 --> 01:54:13,872
for saving me.

1335
01:54:13,872 --> 01:54:15,242
I love you.

1336
01:54:15,902 --> 01:54:17,112
No!

1337
01:54:25,312 --> 01:54:26,322
No!

1338
01:54:53,342 --> 01:54:55,342
It took her only a few months...

1339
01:54:55,342 --> 01:54:58,412
to rise through the ranks of the Second League.

1340
01:54:58,412 --> 01:55:01,682
And tonight,she makes her first appearance

1341
01:55:01,682 --> 01:55:03,452
in the Champions League.

1342
01:55:03,452 --> 01:55:06,752
Where she has a chance at becoming Final Champion...

1343
01:55:06,752 --> 01:55:09,362
and going to Zalem.

1344
01:55:37,152 --> 01:55:40,922
Alita! Alita! Alita!

1345
01:55:40,922 --> 01:55:45,532
Let's hear it for the Battle Angel herself...

1346
01:55:45,532 --> 01:55:47,432
number 99...

1347
01:55:47,432 --> 01:55:50,932
Alita!

1348
01:56:30,372 --> 01:56:33,242
Alita! Alita! Alita!

1349
01:56:52,392 --> 01:56:56,312
